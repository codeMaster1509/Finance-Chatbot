Some of the focus areas are  1) further working on weight reduction of 100kg for the next 10 years  2) in EVs and hybrids using minimum necessary batteries without excess in order to ensure energy efficiency  and 3) working toward a circular economy. Suzuki believes hybrid cars are the best choice until nonfossil based electric energy usage becomes fully widespread. Accordingly MSIL has embraced a multitech approach (working on CNG flex fuels hybrids and EVs) to achieve its emission targets. It is probably the only company in India to be working on diverse technologies to suit Indian consumer needs.

    "Automobile major Tata Motors emerged as the top bet within the sector as it topped the list of stocks that garnered the maximum upgrades from analysts in June. On the other hand rival Maruti Suzuki saw downgrades in the same tenure. Optimism for Tata Motors is emerging from its plans to demerge the commercial vehicles business into one entity and consolidate the passenger vehicles including PV EV and JLR into another entity.According to   s Analyst Call Tracker  buy  calls for Tata Motors rose to 23 in June as against 20 in the month prior. Along with that  sell  and  hold  calls reduced by one each during the month. On the flipside rival Maruti Suzuki saw  buy  calls reduce to 31 in June from the prior 33 while  sell  and  hold  ratings rose by one each.Tata Motors  demerger to unlock valueTata Motors  plans to demerge its businesses into two separate entities are seen as a welcome move by analysts.  Post demerger Tata Motors  PV business will include both the domestic EV segment and the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) business. Consequently its separately listed PV stock will provide an opportunity to invest in both the domestic passenger vehicle market and the global premium passenger vehicle segment  Sharekhan stated in a note.Based on this Sharekhan also believes that the demerger will give investors yet another option to play on the massmarket PV growth story. Accordingly the firm believes that though rival Maruti Suzuki may still sustain its leadership position in the PV segment it may not have its TINA (there is no alternative) tag among investors for long.  Thus considering the structural positive view on PV segment we now prefer Tata Motors over Maruti Suzuki  Sharekhan said.Meanwhile Tata Motors also chalked out its plans to raise its market share in passenger vehicles (PVs) and increase its nonvehicle revenues in commercial vehicles (CVs) yet another move that sparks optimism among analysts.Analysts at Jefferies also noted that in PVs Tata intends to increase its market share from 14 percent in FY24 to 16 percent in FY27 and 1820 percent by FY30. In CVs it intends to gradually increase its market share and deliver strong doubledigit EBITDA margins.Premiumisation Hyundai India IPO a worry for Maruti SuzukiAnalysts at Sharekhan highlighted that even though the PV segment is expected to grow by single digits in FY25 the demand for entrylevel models stays lukewarm as it continues to be skewed toward highend products.Given that Maruti Suzuki represents a classic play on the massmarket PV growth story the rising trend of premiumisation may moderate its earnings growth analysts believe.In addition the muchawaited initial public offer of Hyundai India also gives investors another option to bet on India s growing PV story implying increased competition for Maruti Suzuki s stock. In addition the 17.5 percent surge in shares of Maruti Suzuki in the year so far also prompted analysts to be cautious over prospects of a further upside.Also Read   Analyst Call Tracker April 2024  Optimism eludes IT stocks despite upgrades auto stocks see rating cutsHence even though the company s growth trajectory remains intact analysts choose to prefer other rivals due to the availability of better options.",

    "Grappling with prolonged stock holding periods and sluggish sales auto dealers have asked car makers to delay vehicle dispatches to reduce inventory pileup at their end. While average inventory levels have averaged 4042 days for a long time it has increased to 60 days over the past three months.This surplus has heightened worries about increased interest costs and financial pressure on dealerships. During the last festive season dealers received inventory stocks covering more than 60 days. Subsequently we have been urging OEMs and have even written to SIAM to reduce the dispatch of stocks  Manish Raj Singhania president of the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations told  .While expressing concerns over the rising inventory levels of passenger vehicles at dealerships Singhania said that FADA will also reach out to its industry counterpart Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) to advise its members to moderate the unrestricted inflow of vehicle stocks. Over the last three months we have seen a steady rise in inventory and in May we closed with 55 to 60 days of inventory. That is equivalent to 550000 to 600000 vehicles for a twomonth stock  Singhania added. He foresees similar stock levels at the end of June.Explaining the predicament Singhania stated that auto dealers constantly secure loans to finance vehicle stocks bought from OEMs. These loans come with interest payments meant to be repaid within 60 days.According to the data collated by FADA PV retail sales during April and May totalled 638481 units up by 7.24 percent from 595361 units registered in the corresponding period last year. Similarly total PV wholesalers during April and May were 685886 units just a 1.26 percent increase from 666714 units sold during the same period last year according to SIAM data.Based on this data the total number of unsold stocks stood at 47405 units as of June 1 2024 compared to 71353 units in the same period last year. While the gap narrowed between PV wholesale and retail figures the inventory period nearly doubled to 60 days.A spokesperson for SIAM did not comment on the queries sent by  .The FADA president stated that wholesale figures for all segments including SUVs have stabilised recently.  With the waiting period for SUVs over all vehicles except for a few variants are available offtheshelf at dealerships  Singhania noted.He also said that OEMs need to strike a balance between production levels and demand to prevent overstocking of cars particularly in the hatchback and sedan segments.  OEMs should bill vehicles according to the retail figures in the market. They should not overbill dealers by pushing stocks of lowdemand vehicles. Inventory period extendsSinghania also revealed that OEMs have been pushing banks which offer vehicle financing solutions to extend the revolving credit facility provided to dealers to 90 days to facilitate holding higher levels of inventory. He also claimed that OEMs are urging dealers to extend the tenure of this financing scheme to 90 days with dealers bearing the additional interest costs. While dealers are getting an additional month this scheme enables OEMs to offload more stocks. This would further burden dealerships with interest costs and excess stock  Singhania noted.  If they are extending the financing period they should introduce a scheme to cover the extra interest costs.  In his view a 30day inventory level is manageable.Responding to a query from   India s largest car maker Maruti Suzuki stated that it has a stock level of 35 to 36 days which it considers  manageable .  The company said that its current inventory pipeline totalled 168000 units as of early June and the company does not intend to take any measures to further reduce that count. We have a network stock of 3035 days including transit time. This is neither too high nor too low as we are averaging monthly wholesale numbers of 147000 units. The current levels are also pretty normal and we do not feel under pressure  Partho Banerjee senior executive officer of marketing and sales at MSIL said on June 1.Hyundai Motor India Limited (HMIL) stated that it had an inventory of 44774 units in early June.  With average monthly sales of 50000 units our inventory is less than four weeks. We take pride in maintaining optimal inventory in our network. We have always done so and plan to continue  said Tarun Garg chief operating officer of Hyundai Motor India (HMIL) earlier this month.        ",
