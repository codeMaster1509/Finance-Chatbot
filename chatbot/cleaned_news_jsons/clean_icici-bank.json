    "The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has refused to stay an NCLT order admitting infrastructure firm Jaiprakash Associates Limited into insolvency resolution process.The NCLAT said on June 10 that the Interim Resolution Professional submitted that neither the company s 25000 employees nor ongoing projects would be affected as IRP intended to run the company as a going concern.Sunil Kumar Sharma a suspended company director sought the stay.The NCLAT has directed banks to respond to the appeal and asked them to consider the company s onetime settlement offer. The case will now be heard on June 24.Senior advocate Sandeep Sethi who appeared for Sharma told the court that the order of insolvency had put many infrastructure projects in India and abroad in jeopardy. The company had offered an OTS plan but the NCLT admitted the company to insolvency resolution process before a decision could be reached.The company had already deposited Rs 200 crore of the outstanding Rs 1200 crore it owed to ICICI Bank he said. The OTS would have worked itself out in four and a half months if the NCLT had not passed the insolvency order.Senior advocate Sanjib Sen who appeared for ICICI Bank said it was not a straightforward case as was being made out and the NCLAT should not stay the insolvency process.The company owed more than Rs 30000 crore to various banks and Rs 1200 crore to ICICI Sen said. It would set a wrong example if the proceedings were stayed.The case has been pending in courts for a decade and Jaiprakash Associates tried to defer the insolvency proceedings by seven years on one pretext or the other.A vacation bench of NCLAT while refusing to stay the order of the NCLT s Allahabad bench said it would pass a detailed order giving instructions to the lenders.Jaiprakash Associates has a debt of Rs 29361 crore including interest. In all 22 lenders have exposure to JP Associates  debt.The company has been trying to sell its cement plants to trim the debt but media reports have said the fate of the deal with Dalmia Cement remains uncertain.Jaiprakash Associates and Dalmia Bharat in December 2022 signed a framework for the acquisition of JAL s cement clinker and power plants for an enterprise value of Rs 5666 crore.The National Asset Reconstruction Company of India (NARCL) in MarchApril submitted an Rs 10000crore binding offer to acquire JAL s debt but the lenders sought a better offer reports said.

    "The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is investigating allegations of ICICI Bank employees contacting ICICI Securities shareholders in an attempt to influence them before a vote on delisting proposal in March Mint reported.During the vote the shareholders were to decide on the delisting of ICICI Securities and its merger with its parent company ICICI Bank. Over 500 shareholders of ICICI Securities had collaborated through WhatsApp and social media to file numerous complaints with SEBI. The regulator is presently reviewing several complaints. Once substantiated evidence is gathered SEBI will commence an investigation. The specific actions SEBI may take remain uncertain  the Mint report quoted an unidentified source.Earlier Manu Rishi Guptha a Bengalurubased fund manager and a minority shareholder in ICICI Securities said in an exclusive interaction with   that prior to the board meeting both ICICI Securities and ICICI Bank had been reaching out to retail shareholders of the former persuading them to vote in favor of the merger scheme.Gupta added that the actions have also led to minority shareholder data being compromised as the calls were made by ICICI Bank and not by ICICI Securities which means that the details were shared with them.In the Mint report Guptha also stated that minority investors of ICICI Securities have filed 6070 complaints with the SEBI and also complained on the SCORES platform.
