    "By Rajesh Bhosale technical analyst at Angel OneThe prominent highlight of the last week (ended May 10) was the increasing volatility (India VIX) which saw our markets experiencing significant price corrections despite favourable global cues. By the week s end Nifty witnessed a deep cut of 1.87 percent ending a tad above the 22050 mark.Examining the weekly chart it s evident that prices have been confined within a range for several weeks. This week prices moved from the upper boundary to the lower one signaling a notable shift in trader sentiment. The daily chart depicts a similar pattern resembling a  Rising Channel  affirming a defined range for Indian markets.On Friday prices managed to defend the lower boundary of this pattern coinciding with the 89EMA (exponential moving average) preventing a breakdown. A comparable scenario occurred on April 19 where prices rebounded from this crucial support eventually reaching a new high. While the previous move was supported by a strong  Piercing Line  bullish candlestick pattern this time it s an  Inside Bar  pattern still bullish but less significant.Additionally the RSI (relative strength index) Smoothened has fallen below its previous swing low indicating overall bleak conditions. Traders are advised not to be swayed by temporary rebounds and to maintain light positions until concrete signs of a bullish reversal emerge especially with the impending Lok Sabha election results.Regarding levels Thursday s low coinciding with the 89EMA at 21900 serves as immediate support followed by previous swing lows in the 21800  21700 range. On the upside the zone between the 20 and 50EMA around 22200  22300 presents a formidable obstacle.Here is one buy call and one sell recommendation for short term Avenue Supermarts  Buy   LTP  Rs 4797   StopLoss  Rs 4610   Target  Rs 5140   Return  7 percentOnce considered as a trader s delight this stock has experienced a prolonged period of dormancy over the past year. However there has been a recent technical breakthrough with prices surpassing their previous swing high on the weekly chart affirming a resurgence in the uptrend.Volumes analysis reveals heightened activity during upward movements compared to subdued volumes during declines indicating accumulation in this particular counter.Furthermore prices comfortably exceed key averages with oscillators positioned positively bolstering the buy signal. Despite a widespread market selloff this stock has demonstrated relative strength suggesting that its outperformance is poised to persist.Hence we recommend buying Avenue Supermarts (DMart operator) around Rs 4800  4750 with a stoploss of Rs 4610 and target of Rs 5140.IndusInd Bank  Sell   LTP  Rs 1410   StopLoss  Rs 1457   Target  Rs 1320   Return  6 percentAfter maintaining the key levels of Rs 1430 for several months prices have recently broken below it signaling a bearish reversal pattern identified as the  Inverse Cup and Handle  pattern.

RoA remained strong at 1.9  for Q4FY24 as well as FY24. Gross slippages improved QoQ across subsegments though the bank has part consumed contingent provisions. We believe IIB is well placed on growth NIM and asset quality troika. IIB has delivered amongst the highest CAGR (FY2124) in retail deposits which should sustain fuelling superior  18  CAGR in loans over FY2426.
