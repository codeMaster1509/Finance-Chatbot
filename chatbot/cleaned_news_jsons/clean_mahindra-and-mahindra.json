    "With XUV 3XO s bookings crossing 50000 units within 60 minutes Mahindra and Mahindra (M M) is drawing up a blueprint to ensure that the subcompact (under fourmetre) sports utility vehicle (SUV) does not see monthslong  waitlists. Speaking after the company s Q4FY24 earnings call Rajesh Jejurikar ED and CEO M M Auto and Farm Equipment Services said that a prospective  customer who could be a first time buyer will not wait endlessly for the XUV 3XO as he has multiple options in the market. We are aware that when firsttime buyers want a car they are are not going to wait for months. That s something  we are very alive to. The nature of this buyer is different from the nature of Thar (lifestyle SUV) buyers who don t mind waiting as there s nothing like that  in the market  said Jejurikar.At present Tata Motors  Nexon is the market leader in this segment with sales of 171697 units in FY202324 per industry data . Maruti Suzuki Brezza is  number two with 169897 units followed by Hyundai Venue at third spot with 128897 units.Jejurikar revealed that M M has already produced more than 10000 units of this model and will commence deliveries on 26th May. He also said that the company has already enhanced the XUV 3XO s production capacity to 9000 units per month which is higher than the numbers for the outgoing version ( XUV 3OO). We already have the inventory and with a very short leadtime and minimal investment we can go up to 10500 units (per month). Of course if the numbers go higher than that we will ramp up the output further  added Jejurikar.He also acknowledged that the company is very mindful that if the waiting periods are high it may lead to higher cancellations. We will have to keep up the momentum on the ground to drive demand because it can t be a static customer list. If you re not delivering they re going to drop out and buy something else. That s pretty clear to us  explained Jejurikar.The company reaffirmed its plans to roll out nine SUVs seven of which would be ICE models. While some models will be replacing existing product lines some are tailiormade for the overseas markets. There are ICE and EV portfolios that are getting developed which will enable us to globalise over the next six to seven years. We ll take our time and build market by market. But we need globally competitive products. When we say new ICE products we mean it may be replacing existing models but built on a totally new platform  said Jejurikar.Regarding its Born Electric range of products he said the company is all set to roll out the first model by the first quarter of next calendar year. Talking about positioning he noted that it would be targeted at  a new set of buyers who are looking for aspirational electric cars at reasonable price points. I would put it as an attitude or  psychographic of people who want to stand out do things differently experience new things and are hungry for the latest tech. This product is going to come with tech which is unseen in vehicles at way higher price points. We have been seeing a similar profile even among our ICE customers   averred Jejurikar.While the company has already launched its maiden EV XUV 400 which is based on the same platform that underpins XUV 3OO (now 3XO) its groundup EVs will be priced above Rs 15 lakh. Ideally we don t want the Mahindra ICE customer to move to our EVs. We are hoping to attract those we haven t been able to so far but who have the same psychographics. Then it s a winwin. Of course there may be some cannibalisation but we think that there is enough untapped opportunity for a vehicle of this type which we have not been able to leverage so far with even the XUV700. This is a quantum leap over XUV700  said Jejurikar.        ",

He also revealed that while it continues to do well in tier 2 and 3 cities the  real opportunity  to pick up  substantial volumes  for this model will be from tier 1 cities.According to him the total size of the SUV market last year was about 2.5 million per annum and about half of that was in the sub fourmetre segment at around 1.2 million (per annum). Within that out of 50 percent is subfour metre SUV segment which it considers as the  direct relevant segment .Exuding confidence that the SUV segment will grow faster than passenger cars (sedans hatchbacks) in FY25 he maintained that are not trueblue SUVs.  A substantial chunk of SUVs in India are car crossovers. So it is not a liketolike comparison by saying that it s all pure SUVs (which are selling). I would say that the way SUVs are growing in India is faster than cars.  Buoyed by this existing and upcoming models (5door Thar) we aim to grow in midteens in our overall volumes during FY 25 Jejurikar further added.Puneet Gupta director S P Global Mobility is of the view that the XUV 3XO has the potential to revolutionize Mahindra s presence in the sub 4meter SUV segment enabling the company to capture a larger portion of the compact SUV market. Given Mahindra s current dominance in the midsize SUV segment they might be considering expansion into other sub segments as well. X3o at this price will be a game changer product and can be among the customer favourites due to fresh and stunning looks  said Gupta.         ",

In this sixlakh segment (of subcompact SUVs) which is 25 percent of the market we are actually the number fifth player. This is a big opportunity for us to disrupt. In the next three years we target to be number one or two in the subcompact monocoque SUV segment. To plan for this we have to do something disruptive and that is where the 3XO came in from  added Jejurikar.The model will be rolled out from its Nashik facility where its outgoing version (earlier named XUV 3OO) was also made. The capacity of this facility is 9000 units per month (including XUV 4OO electric SUV) which will be enhanced to 10500 units per month in the medium term.The XUV 3XO will be available with three engine options (2 petrol and 1 diesel) and transmission options will include 6speed manual 6speed automatic and a 6speed AMT.

    "Nearly six months after awarding 5star ratings to Tata Safari and Harrier SUVs the Global New Car Assessment Programme (Global NCAP) has awarded three two and one star ratings to Kia Carens Honda Amaze and Mahindra Bolero respectively.This assessment marks one of the final evaluations under Global NCAP s Safer Cars for India initiative as the country transitions to its own Bharat NCAP safety evaluation program.The 2024 Kia Carens received a 3star rating for adult safety and 5 stars for child safety. GNAP revealed that the overall build quality of the newer version has been improved by enhancing neck performance and restraint systems according to GNAP.The Kia India Spokesperson did not respond to emails until the time of publishing this story.While disclosing the test results Alejandro Furas Global NCAP SecretaryGeneral said  There has been an improvement in Kia s rating for the Carens since our original test when the model scored a zero rating for adult occupant protection. However we were expecting a better performance in the retest given the Carens is fitted with six airbags as standard. The Honda Amaze which previously secured a fourstar rating for adult occupant protection and one star for child occupant protection during its 2019 assessment saw a drop in its ratings under more stringent testing standards. The sedan s rating dropped to two stars for adult protection and plummeted to zero stars for child safety. Regrettably Honda did not take the opportunity to update the Amaze with more safety features which explains its disappointing score  added Furas.Honda Cars India Ltd. (HCIL) in an emailed response stated that the South Africaspec 2nd Generation Amaze had already been tested as 4 stars by GNCAP in 2019. The latest test based on new protocol shows that the total score is of a 5star level with a stable body shell. However mainly due to the requirement of certain equipment like Electronic Stability Control and Side Curtain Airbags it resulted in a lower rating  HCIL said in an emailed statement adding  We are dedicated to continuously working to enhance our vehicles on all parameters of Safety and improve them further at model change timing. The Mahindra Bolero Neo a sub 4m SUV widely acclaimed for its versatility and robustness garnered a 1star safety rating for both adult and child safety. The model was tested and showed low protection for adult protection in the frontal crash with an unstable structure unstable footwell area weak chest protection for the driver and poor feet protection according to GNCAP. We at Mahindra are committed to delivering vehicles that ensure the safety and satisfaction of our customers and users. The Bolero Neo is the trusted utility vehicle of choice in India owing to its robust build highly dependable nature and its innate capability to handle a variety of usage conditions. It has always complied with safety regulations that have been introduced over time and continues to be fully compliant with the latest Indian safety standards  M M said in an emailed reply to queries sent by  .According to David Ward President of the Towards Zero Foundation this mixed set of results demonstrates that more effort is still needed from some manufacturers to prioritize vehicle safety in the Indian market. We have seen a great deal of improvement throughout our  SaferCarsforIndia campaign but it s clear that maintaining this safety momentum is crucially important. We will be discussing this and other key vehicle safety matters for India during an NCAP24 panel session later today.          ",
