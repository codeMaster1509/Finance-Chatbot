    "Minority shareholders are expected to benefit from the demerger of ITC s hotel business into a separate entity ITC Hotels as it may unlock value for them and improve return ratios of the FMCG major as per reports of four proxy advisory firms.The reports from proxy advisory firms including InGovern Research Services ISS and SES come ahead of the June 6 meeting of shareholders of ITC to consider and approve the demerger proposal.According to proxy advisory firm ISS the demerger may unlock value for its shareholders and improve ITC s return ratios. The structure will enable ITC Hotels to operate with an optimal capital structure with the ability to access capital to fund its growth requirements. It can attract the right set of investors strategic partners and collaborations whose investment strategies are more sharply aligned with that of the hospitality industry  ISS said in its report.Last year in August ITC board had approved the demerger of its hotels business into a separate entity. Shareholders of ITC will get one share in the soontobelisted hotel entity for every 10 shares they hold in the company.Highlighting the benefit of demerger another advisory firm InGovern said that the current ITC shareholders will receive a direct stake in a dedicated publicly traded hotel entity becoming shareholders of a specialised company focused solely on the hotel business.This move aligns with ITC s corporate strategy of fostering multiple growth drivers ensuring continued interest in the hotel sector and protecting against potential hostile takeovers in the future it said. Given the clean swap of shares which is beneficial for the minority shareholders as well as for the growth of both the companies we recommend shareholders vote for this scheme of arrangement  it said.Proxy advisory firm SES is of the view that the decision to keep 40 per cent stake with ITC is a strategic decision to give stability and allow fair discovery of price and is in interest of shareholders. SES does not identify any major concern with regard to the proposed demerger.Another proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis has also recommended the proposed demerger scheme.However Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS) has suggested shareholders of ITC Ltd to vote against the proposed demerger of the hotel business on the grounds that it does not provide complete value unlocking for shareholders.

It remains uncertain whether they plan to sell this equity to a strategic buyer or keep it. IiAS is asking the management for more details on this issue.

It said  Since ITC Hotels will have mirror shareholding (60 percent of ITC) and balance will remain with ITC the valuation is immaterial at this stage. Further as ITC Hotels will be listed value will be through a transparent price discovery mechanism. Hence no concern is identified in this regard. The hotel segment is the smallest in ITC s portfolio contributing only 3 to 5 percent to its overall revenue.

    "During the week ended April 26 the market particularly the Nifty 50 showed rangebound behaviour despite an initial gapup opening on Monday. Throughout the week it struggled to break free from this consolidation pattern eventually closing with modest gains of approximately 1.23 percent. Despite attempts to breach the resistance at 22600 the Nifty failed to sustain above it and a sharp downturn in the final session led to the erosion of most of its gains.From a technical standpoint the Nifty is trading within a rising channel pattern suggesting potential bullish momentum if it manages to maintain levels above 22300 in the current week with a likely target range of 2275022800.Additionally the longshort ratio of foreign institutional investors (FIIs) stands at 39 percent indicating limited downside potential.Looking forward immediate resistance levels for the Nifty are projected at 2270022800 and a decisive close above this range could trigger renewed buying interest in the index futures. Conversely a breach of the support at 22300 might intensify the selling pressure in the markets.As for the Nifty Bank index it experienced a notable uptrend rallying approximately 2000 points from the low of 46600 levels and ending the week with gains of about 1.32 percent. However the breakout from the cupandhandle pattern faced significant resistance in the 4860048700 zone notably near the previous top recorded on December 28 2023 at 48636.Surpassing the 49000 level appears challenging for the Nifty Bank with support seen at 47700  a breach of this level could potentially trigger further selling in the index.Here are three buy calls for the next 23 weeks Navin Fluorine International  Buy   LTP  Rs 3310   StopLoss  Rs 3095   Target  Rs 3700   Return  12 percentFollowing its Double Top formation near the Rs 49004800 zone Navin Fluorine has experienced a significant downturn shedding 41 percent in price.

To manage risk a stoploss order should be placed near Rs 3095 helping to limit potential losses in case the trade doesn t perform as expected.NOTE  If the price is making lower lows but the oscillator is making higher lows this is considered to be regular bullish divergence.ITC  Buy   LTP  Rs 440   StopLoss  Rs 412   Target  Rs 480   Return  9 percentAfter reaching a peak near Rs 475 mark on January 4 2024 ITC has experienced a significant decline of approximately 16 percent.

    "India s diversified entity ITC plans to open more hotels overseas with neighbouring countries and the Middle East as primary target markets after opening of its first international property here company Chairman and Managing Director Sanjiv Puri said on Thursday.The company s arm ITC Hotels which had opened 22 new properties in the last 24 months plans to add another 70 hotels in the next five years in India as part of expansion plans in the hospitality sector. Besides the hotels business the company will look for opportunities to expand the presence of FMCG and other verticals in new overseas markets as well. We are open to exploring opportunities that come about. I think we have strong credentials in hospitality which we can take outside India now. Very clearly at the moment the focus is on proximal markets be it for hospitality be it for FMCG   Puri said here at a press conference after the opening of the 352room luxury property ITC Ratnadipa here. He said as the company explores and understands a place for a particular business it may look at it as a market for other verticals as well.Citing the example of Nepal Puri said We started with other businesses and are now looking at hospitality (there). Here (in Sri Lanka) we have started with hospitality as we explore and understand the place we will look at possibilities in some of our other sectors as well.  On overseas expansion of the hospitality business while the company s focus is more on  proximal markets  he said We are open to it if there are some interesting opportunities beyond it. We will certainly be interested in pursuing that. When asked if ITC is looking at the Middle East as a market for the hospitality business he said it is a vibrant economy right now with terrific growth plans and  if opportunity comes our way then we will certainly explore that . Puri also said the company will look to expand in more destinations in Sri Lanka going forward. This (opening of ITC Ratnadipa) is the starting point and yes we want to expand and grow the economy and contribute to the development of tourism in Sri Lanka  he said. When asked about ITC s overall expansion plans in the hospitality sector he said We have a very healthy pipeline of 70 hotels in five years. All these 70 hotels are for the Indian domestic market and most of them will be the upscale segments. He however said  (For) overseas we re just starting our journey. So we have not yet got to the stage to start putting a number right here. On investments planned for the overall expansion he did not share a specific number but said  between renovation and new properties will spend somewhere between Rs 700 crore to Rs 1000 crore a year . When asked about the progress of the demerger of ITC Hotels and its planned public listing Puri said it is happening in line with the indicated timelines and is expected  before the second half of this year or the end of this year .At its new property here the company had invested about USD 500 million. It was inaugurated on Thursday by Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe. The ITC Ratnadipa or  Island of Gems  has 352 guest rooms suites and service apartments each with private balconies with waterfront views.Earlier in the day speaking at the opening of the new hotel Puri said It is very natural for us to specifically focus on markets in proximal areas encouraged also by our Prime Minister s (Narendra Modi) vision of neighbourhood first where Sri Lanka has a very special position. ITC is deeply committed to growing our presence and contributing to hospitality in the region.         ",
