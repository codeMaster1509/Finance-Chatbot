    "UltraTech Cement is set to present its earnings report for the first fiscal quarter of FY25 on July 19. Sequentially India s largest grey cement ready mix concrete and white cement manufacturer is expected to deliver a subpar performance in Q1FY25 despite a rise in volumes primarily due to weak prices and a decline in average realisations that will impact earnings.According to a   poll UltraTech Cement s net profit is expected to slump 30 percent QoQ to Rs 1733 crore. Revenue is also seen falling 13 percent sequentially to Rs 17962 crore.On a yearonyear basis however net profit and revenue are seen rising 2.5 percent and 1.3 percent respectively.The most optimistic estimate sees Ultratech Cement s net profit rising 19 percent onyear respectively. But the most pessimistic projection suggests that net profit might sink eight percent YoY.What factors are driving the earnings Demand Slowdown  The slowdown in construction activities during the general elections in April and May adversely impacted cement sales in these months. Scorching heat labour shortages and unseasonal rain in some regions further dented demand during Q1FY25.Muted prices  Cement prices entered Q1F25 with a steep hike announcement in some regions but with lowerthanhistorical average demand and a sudden rampup of M As among large players sustaining any price hike became impossible. Hikes implemented in April were reversed during May and June due to soft demand and stiff competition.Decline in realisations  According to analysts at Motilal Oswal blended realization is likely to decline around three percent YoY. Price realisation in cement refers to the average revenue a company earns per unit sold. It helps gauge the average income per ton with higher realisation indicating better profitability per unit.High Costs  The cement maker s depreciation interest expenses are estimated to increase up to eight percent onyear likely causing a negative operating leverage which occurs when a company s fixed costs are high causing profits to decline disproportionately as sales decrease.Combined with lower price realisations this can significantly hamper net earnings.According to analysts at BOBCAPS UltraTech Cement s growth stayed at a higher single digit after a very strong Q4FY24 as the company focuses on retaining prices at relatively better levels than its peers. Volume growth of around 8.5 percent is despite strong competition from the peer set. Operating efficiencies likely to move margins into positive territory  it said.What to look out for in the quarterly show Analysts will be keeping a close eye on management commentary on the demand scenario amidst a seasonally weak quarter price sustainability amidst intensifying competition and consolidation in the sector.",

    "Sharekhan s research report on UltraTech CementUltratech s board recently approved making a financial investment to purchase up to 7.06 crore equity shares of The India Cements at a price up to Rs. 267 per share constituting a 23  stake in India Cements. The transaction is valued at Rs. 1885 crore valuing India Cements at an EV tonne of  90 tonne. As of now an open offer is not triggered as it does not breach 25  stake. However further stake acquisitions to control majority ownership in India Cements cannot be ruled out. The investment follows the recent acquisition of Penna Cements by Ambuja and can be viewed as Ultratech s strategic move to secure its regional and market leadership.OutlookUltraTech is well poised to benefit from a strong demand environment led by government spending on infrastructure and rising demand from the housing sector. Industry consolidation structural demand drivers and softening fuel prices provide operational profitability growth tailwinds. Although movement of cement prices would remain a key monitorable in the near to medium term. Currently we have not factored in India Cements stake acquisition in our financials awaiting further clarity on its future plans with respect to further stake acquisitions. At CMP the stock is trading at an EV EBITDA of 22.8x 18.5x its FY2025E FY2026E earnings which we believe provides further room for upside. Hence considering its longterm growth potential we maintain our Buy rating on the stock with a revised PT of Rs. 13000 owing to strong earnings growth outlook over FY2024FY2026E.For all recommendations report click here",

While the deal objective is stated to be a  noncontrolling financial investment  we see it as a smart  foot in the door  move towards a potential acquisition bid for ICEM. With acquisition of a controlling stake appearing to be a  long shot  and Street s misplaced judgement of seeing the deal as a potent positive for pricing outlook (citing odds of rising consolidation) we stay neutral on the deal.OutlookAlthough we value the 23  stake at INR 142 share of UTCEM (being the difference in EV t of UTCEM and the current deal) we are not convinced on assigning a higher valuation multiple to UTCEM citing the underlying competitive intensity despite rising industry consolidation.

    "The Street cheered Ultratech Cement s acquisition of a 23 percent stake in Chennaibased India Cements for Rs 1889 crore pushing the stock to a record high of Rs 11875 per share on June 27. Analysts predict this deal could lead to a larger stake purchase and establish a new  Thalaiva  (dominant player) in the Southern market.This move came two weeks after the Adani Group s Ambuja Cements announced its acquisition of Penna Cements a South Indiabased company for Rs 10422 crore.Investec analysts noted that Ultratech s acquisition could boost its capacity share in South India from 11 percent to 18 percent particularly enhancing its presence in Telangana where it previously had no operations.ALSO READ    Pro Panorama   UltraTech cements its no1 positionIndia Cements currently has a cement production capacity of 14.5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) and a clinker capacity of 11.13 MTPA.

The deal involves purchasing 70.6 million shares of India Cements at Rs 267 each. This transaction described by UltraTech as a  noncontrolling financial investment  is expected to be finalised within a month according to a stock exchange filing.Read  Potential hostile takeover by UltraTech brewing in India Cements Here s a snapshot of how the two cement companies fared in terms of key financial metrics and stock performance.India Cements earningsThe company reported its fifth consecutive quarterly loss in the March 2024 quarter with revenue continuing to decline yearonyear for the fourth straight quarter. The company ranked tenth largest in the cement sector is grappling with working capital shortages. This has been exacerbated by intense price competition following the Adani Group s entry into the industry through the acquisition of Ambuja Cements Ltd and ACC Ltd in 2022.As of March 2024 all shares held by promoters led by managing director N Srinivasan were pledged with banks up from 45 percent at the end of December 2023. In response to these challenges India Cements has been actively taking steps to alleviate its working capital constraints including asset sales. The company s Q4 performance reflects these efforts showing some improvement according to experts.The management anticipates significant relief in working capital following the recent sale of noncore and core assets such as land and a grinding plant. They have expressed cautious optimism regarding demand and pricing trends and clarified their intention not to sell further core assets for business funding focusing instead on operational efficiencies. The management has sounded confident about resolving working capital issues and improving business operations in the coming quarters. But analysts remain watchful given the company s historical performance relative to peers. ultra vs india cementUltraTech Cement earningsIndia s largest cement manufacturer reported a strong revenue growth in Q4 driven by robust demand across key markets. Improved operating leverage favorable fuel prices and effective cost controls contributed to margin expansion.UltraTech Cement is aggressively pursuing acquisitions to achieve its ambitious target of increasing capacity from 147 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) to 200 mtpa. In December 2023 the company announced the acquisition of Kesoram Industries  cement assets for Rs 7600 crore. This transaction awaiting regulatory approvals in 23 quarters includes two integrated cement units in Karnataka and Telangana with a total grinding capacity of 10.75 million tonnes (MT). Additionally UltraTech expanded into Jharkhand through the acquisition of Burnpur Cement adding 0.5 MT grinding capacity.In FY24 UltraTech invested around Rs 9200 crore in capital expenditures increasing its domestic manufacturing capacity to about 141 MT (excluding Kesoram). The company plans to maintain a similar capex runrate next year and aims to achieve a total capacity of around 157 MT by March 2025.Analysts expected strong demand for cement from from rural and infrastructure sectors alongside increasing orders from urban real estate. The management is optimistic about a prolonged favorable demand environment in the cement sector.UltraTech s expansion plans for phases 2 (22.6 mtpa) and 3 (21.9 mtpa) are progressing as scheduled aiming for completion by FY2027. Coupled with the acquisition of Kesoram (10.75 mtpa) this will elevate its total cement capacity to 195.4 mtpa (including overseas capacities). UltraTech is wellpositioned to capitalise on the expanding cement demand expected over the next 45 years with a positive outlook on profitability and balance sheet strength. ultra vs india cementStock price performanceIn 2023 UltraTech Cement significantly outperformed India Cement in terms of stock performance.

    "The announcement by UltraTech Cement to acquire a 23 percent stake in India Cements has sparked discussions about a potential hostile takeover.The acquisition of shares in the South Indiabased cement maker will place UltraTech in a significant position within India Cements a company long associated with its owner N Srinivasan who along with other promoter group members holds only a 28.42 percent stake.The Stakes and the PlayersAs the largest manufacturer of cement in India the Kumar Mangalam Birlaled UltraTech s move can be seen as a calculated effort to consolidate its dominance in the market. On the other hand India Cements with its historical significance and strong market presence represents a valuable addition to any portfolio.Srinivasan a prominent figure in the Indian cement industry and the vicechairman and managing director of India Cements now finds himself in a delicate position. With less than 29 percent stake his control over the company is vulnerable. The difference between UltraTech s newly acquired 23 percent stake and Srinivasan s stake is slim heightening the possibility of a power struggle.UltraTech s plans to pick up a major stake in India Cements comes at a time when its biggest rival in the cement industry  the Adani group  has been rapidly increasing its size and scale with acquisitions. Last week Adani group announced that it will acquire Penna Cements for over Rs 10000 crore adding 10 million tonnes per annum capacity to its portfolio. Last year it bagged a controlling stake in Sanghi Cements.India Cements has a capacity of over 15.5 mtpa.Aditya Birla group itself became the biggest cement manufacturer in the country when it acquired UltraTech from L T in 2004.While UltraTech in its stock exchange filing has labeled this stake purchase as a financial investment analysts believe that the rationale behind the move could be to thwart the ambitions of any other corporate rival from making a acquisition move on India Cements.Large conglomerates such as Adani group and JSW group have been eyeing inorganic growth opportunities in the sector where demand is expected to grow at a strong pace in the coming years driven by rising infrastrudture spends by the Indian government and a revival of private sector capex.While UltraTech did not disclose the names of the India Cements shareholders from whom it intends to purchase the stake the public shareholding of India Cements is dominated by three main investors with Dmart founder Radhakishan Damani holding the biggest chunk of 20.78 percent stake followed by ELM Park Fund Ltd holding a 5.58 percent stake and LIC which holds a 3.6 percent stake.As much as 20 percent equity stake in India Cements was sold in the block deal window on Thursday 27 June.Hostile Takeover  A Real Possibility A hostile takeover occurs when an acquiring company seeks to gain control of a target company against the wishes of its management. The relatively close stakes between UltraTech and Srinivasan suggest that UltraTech could potentially pursue this route. If UltraTech decides to increase its stake further it might challenge Srinivasan s control and push for changes in the management and strategic direction of India Cements.While the acquisition of a 23 percent stake will not trigger a mandatory open offer of 26 percent from public shareholders as the stake purchase is below the threshold of 25 percent needed to exercise control under Sebi regulations UltraTech can go ahead and announce a open offer to acquire stake from the public shareholders if it intends to take over control of the company.Additionally the broader context of the Indian cement industry should be considered. The sector has seen consolidation over the past few years with major players looking to enhance their capacities and market share through acquisitions. UltraTech s recent move could be interpreted as part of this larger trend positioning itself more favourably in an increasingly competitive market.The Road AheadThe coming months will be crucial in determining whether this acquisition will lead to a hostile takeover. Stakeholders and market analysts will be watching closely as both companies navigate this complex situation. For now the possibility of a hostile takeover at India Cements remains speculative but given the stakes and the players involved it cannot be ruled out.Emails sent to UltraTech Cement India Cements and Radhakishan Damani did not elicit a response till the time of publishing.

    "India s infrastructure and capex boom through projects like the PM Gati Shakti is creating opportunities in the stock market as well Morgan Stanley said listing out key names that it is bullish on.Analysts at Morgan Stanley have cited Larsen   Toubro NTPC Titagarh Rail Systems and Ultratech Cement as among the key names benefitting from the government spend on infrastructure. The capex boom is also expected to dampen inflation and boost corporate profitability according to the analysts.A Morgan Stanley note informed investors that the momentum that India s infrastructure development has seen over the last decade is projected to continue. Analysts expect infrastructure investments to rise from 5.3 percent of GDP in FY24 to 6.5 percent of GDP by FY29 reflecting a robust 15.3 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR). This increase will result in cumulative spending of approximately  1.45 trillion over the next five years the note said.This surge in infrastructure investment is expected to enhance overall investment rate and foster a period of sustained high productive growth.Follow our market blog to catch all the live actionBeneficiaries of India s infra push1. Larsen   Toubro (L T)According to Morgan Stanley increased government spend on infrastructure projects would likely benefit L T significantly. Additionally a moderation in steel and other material prices could improve the company s cost structure.An overall improvement in the economy leading to higherthananticipated private capex would also be a positive driver for L T.However a slowdown in governmentled infrastructure capex is a key risk for the company s prospects so is a slowdown in the execution cycle which could hamper project completion and profitability. Geopolitical risks could lead to slower execution of projects and a sharp increase in material costs could squeeze margins.2. NTPCAccording to Morgan Stanley the potential upside for NTPC includes faster capacity addition driven by stronger power demand and improving health of State Electricity Boards (SEBs) valueaccretive acquisitions and value unlocking in subsidiaries.On the downside risks involve delays in commissioning fixed cost underrecovery due to coal or machine availability issues investments in noncore businesses and valuedecreasing acquisitions.3. Titagarh Rail SystemsFor Titagarh Rail Systems Morgan Stanley s base case is derived from a target P E of 35x for September 2026 earnings. This multiple is considered fair given strong earnings visibility from a large backlog and improving return ratios which are the best among peers the foreign brokerage said.An improvement in freight margins and a fasterthanexpected rampup in passenger coach execution are significant positive drivers for Titagarh. Additionally an acceleration in passenger segment margins beyond expectations would further enhance the company s financial performance said analysts.Also Read   Goldman Sachs has a Sell on Tata Tech VinFast reliance a vulnerabilityHowever supply chain issues could affect the freight business and hamper execution. A slowdown or delay in wagon tendering and ordering for passenger coaches could hurt operating margins.Additionally delayed execution of contractual obligations could lead to liquidated damages which would negatively affect the company s financial health.4. Ultratech CementMorgan Stanley believes that despite nearterm uncertainties the mediumterm demand visibility for Ultratech Cement remains strong. The brokerage note has identified several factors that could drive the stock s performance including continued demand and a sharp decline in input prices.However a weakerthanexpected demand offtake is possible if the macroeconomic situation worsens and a rise in input prices could increase overall costs without corresponding higher realizations thus denting company s profitability.",

However in the subsequent two trading sessions Dalmia Bharat demonstrated resilience by avoiding further drops and instead reversed around the middle Bollinger band. Notably in the prior trading session there was considerable buying activity observed at lower price levels suggesting investor interest in purchasing the stock at these levels.From a technical perspective the daily DMI (Daily Movement Index) indicator has given a bull cross indicating a potential shift in momentum and presenting an attractive buying opportunity.

Phase 3 expansion plans include adding 22MT capacity at USD72 t with an estimated IRR of 15 percent. The company awaits regulatory approvals for the acquisition of Kesoram which is expected to be completed by March 2025 taking Ultratech s capacity to over 190MT by FY27F. The management is confident about achieving the 200MT capacity organically.Despite recent price increases lower consumption in the election quarter may lead to moderated prices with a projected 1  sequential decline in blended realisation. Volume moderation in the election quarter may result in 7 percent higher fixed costs in 1QFY25F leading to an expected moderation in EBITDA t to Rs 1080 t in 1QFY25F.Jefferies India  Ultratech s performance in the fourth quarter surpassed expectations with EBITDA growing by 24 percent YoY and 26 percent QoQ. This was despite weak prices being balanced out by slightly better volumes ( 11  YoY) increased other operating income and reduced overheads.The management emphasised targeted cost savings of Rs 200300 per ton in the medium term to drive profitability. We have adjusted our FY25 EBITDA estimate downward by 2 percent but maintain our FY26 estimates. This adjustment is due to our revised expectation of flat price growth YoY (previously estimated at  12 percent YoY) anticipating margin expansion in FY25 as costsaving initiatives from the second half of FY24 continue into FY25.Dolat Capital  Ultretech s capacity is set to increase from 146.2 152.7 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) in FY24 Q1FY25 to 162.4 184.9 mtpa by FY25E FY26E. With additions like 10.75 mtpa from Kesoram and 5.4 mtpa from overseas the total consolidated cement capacity will reach 199.6 mtpa by FY27E supporting future growth. Healthy operating cash flow (averaging Rs 144.6 billion year over FY24FY26E) and free cash flow (averaging Rs 34.6 billion year over FY24FY26E) will lead to deleveraging.Ultratech as the largest player in the Indian cement industry has a significant advantage. Additionally we anticipate issuing approximately 5.97 million new equity shares (2 percent) to Kesoram Industries  shareholders in FY26E.B K Securities  Ultratech continued its doubledigit volume growth for the second consecutive year surpassing industry averages. Rapid capacity utilisation postcommissioning reflects strong brand and distribution.
