    "Leisure jewellery outofhome food and healthcare businesses and particularly the premium brands from these businesses will benefit from the rising population of  affluent  Indians according to Goldman Sachs.A report titled  The Rise of Affluent India  authored by analysts in Goldman Sachs  Global Investment Research division said that several data points including bank deposits tax filings and credit card usage point to a fastgrowing demographic of affluent Indians. The analysts defined affluent Indians as those earning an annual income of more than  10000.Also read   Affluent India  growing at 12  vs total population s 1  divergence seen in stock performance  Goldman SachsSeveral stocks could benefit from the trend but the analysts have picked out eight names within their coverage based on two factors. These eight stocks also have according to the analysts  highquality businesses with strong competitive advantages proven track records of past performance and market leadership within their segments .1. TitanTitan has a 78 percent market share in jewellery (FY22) which is largely the upperincome end of jewellery consumption given the higher mix of diamond jewellery and complex gold jewellery compared to other large organised jewellers and momandpop stores. The brand is priced at a premium to most other jewellers in the market due to its aspirational brand range of offerings and transparent policies around the exchange of old jewellery. As the analysts expect the cohort of  Affluent India  consumers to grow by 12 percent CAGR they also expect Titan to have a tailwind of increasing consumer footfall and rising market share. The brand is gaining market share by entering new cities increasing its presence in wedding jewellery with more regional customisation and international business expansion. Store expansion will be a key growth driver for Tanishq.2. Apollo HospitalsWith the disease burden in the country shifting towards  Lifestyle  versus communicable Apollo s ARPOB (Average revenue per occupied bed) is industryleading in a combination of performing the largest number of tertiary quaternary care procedures thanks to its brand capital and medical expertise from 13200 practising doctors (both employed and service fee based). Also the hospitals have been delivering clinical outcomes that are best in class which are metrics that Affluent Indians will pay close attention to. As of FY23 84 percent of Apollo Hospitals payor mix comprised two segments of households   housesholds with higher per capital income and with a propensity to pay for highend tertiary quaternary care either out of pocket or houses that are sufficiently covered by health insurance   and the analysts expect the hospital brand to remain dominant going forward with further shifts towards insurance as awareness increases.According to them growth in health insurance has been one of the drivers of higher ARPOB.3. Phoenix Millshe analysts believe Phoenix s mall portfolio is poised for 25 percent EBITDA growth CAGR (FY23FY27) driven by the rising cohort of  Affluent India   inmall tenant premiumisation and densification  and new mall additions. Beyond FY27 they expect its mall portfolio to deliver 1012 percent annual organic consumption growth in line with consumer discretionary growth. Also they noted that mature malls for Phoenix generate a posttax ROCE of 15 percent which provides cash flows to reinvest in the construction of new malls (with JV partners) without taking up leverage.The report stated that 90 percent of consumption in Phoenix malls is in discretionary categories (see below data as of H1FY24) which cater to the  Affluent India  cohort.Also with Phoenix having established a track record amongst retailers the analysts see lower earnings risk for Phoenix compared to other malls as typically any new mall announcement in a new city leads to at least 70 percent of the space being preleased with those retailers (based on historical trends).4. Makemytrip (MMYT)The Indian travel industry is expected to grow at 13 percent FY24E27E CAGR (in line with growth in Affluent India) with online growth expected to grow faster at 15 percent CAGR over the same period. Within travel the analysts expect relatively premium categories such as international travel and mid highend hotels to be the fastest growing segments (greater than 20 percent growth) driven by both a shift to online and rising income levels. MMYT is India s largest online travel platform with around 50 percent market share  and the analysts forecast 20 percent 34 percent FY24E27E revenue EBITDA CAGR and view MMYT as a key beneficiary of doubledigit growth in India s  affluent  income cohort the core user base of the company. Also the brand has exposure to underpenetrated segments of hotels and international travel which will help the brand grow faster than the market  and the analysts don t see the competition dynamics in the Indian market changing much. With 5x the scale of its nearest competitor and a strong balance sheet the analysts see limited risks to the company s market share.The analysts forecast revenue growth for MMYT to be the highest among global peers.5. ZomatoThe analysts estimate the number of transacting users in India s online grocery and food delivery industry (of 2530 million monthly transacting users or MTUs) is a subset of the  Affluent India  cohort and expect growth in these segments to be indexed to the 13 percent population growth of this cohort. This is expected to be further aided by AOV (average order value) and frequency growth and shift to online resulting in around 2035 percent GOV (gross order value) CAGR across food delivery online grocery industries over FY24E27E. They forecast 2245 percent FY24E27E GOV (gross order value) CAGR for Zomato s food delivery online grocery with MTUs being the biggest growth driver.The analysts expect India s food delivery and online grocery MTU base to track growth in income levels...6 7. Devyani and Sapphire (Yum Indian franchisees)These are Yum India franchisees and the analysts are optimistic about KFC s growth prospects in India.Quick service restaurants (QSRs) have been the fastest growing restaurant format in India with around 25 percent CAGR over FY1020 the analysts noted and added that the QSR demand has come largely from the Affluent India cohort. The customer base of QSR in India at around 30 mn is a subset of their estimate of around 60 million  Affluent Indians . Among QSR formats the analysts preferred KFC in India because of its underpenetration   only 1000 KFC outlets vs 3000 pizza QSR outlets. The reason for this was the unattractive unit economics before FY19 which has since then been improved with initiatives such as lowering store sizes and higher share of delivery through food aggregators. The brand is also the dominant fried chicken player in the country.Goldman Sachs  research team expects a cyclical recovery in KFC s average daily sales (ADS) per store starting FY25.Also read  Goldman Sachs predicts govt capex growth to decline to 10  in FY25 down from 30  in last 3 years8. Eicher MotorsThe brand is usually the second or third motorcycle in the customers  ownership journey representing aspirational positioning. Royal Enfield s average selling price (ASP) is 3x the ASP of the average motorcycle. Also the larger trend in the market is favourable for the brand. The analysts pointed to the 350cc  market consistently outgrowing the 2W market   11 percent CAGR vs flat growth of the broader 2W market over FY15 to FY23  and  15 percent vs  7 percent of the broader market in FY24. Therefore the points in its favour are the company s exposure to the premiumisation trend in automotive buying lower nearterm risk from electrification in premium motorcycling strong pipeline of upcoming product launches (Shotgun 650 unveiled 10 new models refreshes expected over the next 3 years)  ability to withstand multiple competitive threats even from Harley Davidson and Triumph upside optionality from higher contribution by more profitable accessories merchandising business.

    "India witnessed a remarkable 21 percent yearonyear (YoY) growth in smartwatch shipments during the third quarter of 2023 (JulySeptember) according to the latest research from Counterpoint s IoT Service. The surge was attributed to a significant inventory buildup in anticipation of robust sales during the festive season in October.While existing top players continued to drive the market new players like Fastrack and beatXP shipped high volumes and chipped away market share from the top three. The share of domestic manufacturing reached the highest ever at 82 percent compared to 4 percent a year ago the report added. While existing top players continued to drive the market new players like Fastrack and beatXP shipped high volumes and chipped away market share from the top three. In the coming years the market will continue to grow in double digits due to the brands  efforts to expand their portfolios offline partnerships with several largeformat retailers (LFRs) and growing emphasis on local manufacturing  said Anshika Jain senior research analyst.FireBoltt emerged as the market leader capturing an impressive 28 percent share closely trailed by Noise and boAt. Notably Fastrack a subbrand of Titan achieved the highest annual growth among the top five brands showcasing its increasing prominence in the sector. Additionally beatXP made its debut in the top five marking a notable entry into the competitive smartwatch market.Commenting on the price analysts noted the emphasis on budgetfriendly options has led to a significant 41 percent YoY decline in India s smartwatch average selling price (ASP) reaching its alltime low. Consequently more than threefifths of the market now falls within the less than Rs 2000 price range. This quarter smartwatches were even available for less than Rs 1000 to target firsttime users. The shorter replacement cycles for the basic smartwatches and the maximum number of new launches being in this price segment further accelerated the trend  said Harshit Rastogi Research Analyst.
