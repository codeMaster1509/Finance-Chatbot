Holding that the electoral bonds scheme was  unconstitutional and manifestly arbitrary  the Supreme Court directed the SBI on February 15 to furnish the complete details of the bonds purchased since April 12 2019 to the EC which would publish the information on its website by March 13.On March 11 the court dismissed the SBI s petition seeking an extension of the deadline and ordered it to disclose the details of the electoral bonds to the EC by the close of business hours on March 12.

A fivejudge bench headed by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud said it had directed the disclosure of all the details of the bonds including the names of the purchasers amounts and dates of purchase.All details have to be furnished by the SBI the CJI observed as the court admonished the bank for furnishing incomplete information a day after the EC put out the entire list of entities that purchased the bonds for making political donations. The SBI had said a total of 22217 electoral bonds of varying denominations were purchased by the donors between April 1 2019 and February 15 this year of which 22030 were redeemed by political parties.

    "Bernstein downgraded shares of the State Bank of India to  marketperform  citing limited upside and raised its target price for the stock to Rs 780 from Rs 710 on the bank s willingness to improve its capital levels. The broking firm also highlighted factors that would drive underperformance in public sector banks compared to their private peers.At 10.34am shares of SBI traded 0.1 percent higher at Rs 788.95. The stock has gained over 33 percent in the past six months.Bernstein said that although public sector banks have outshone private lenders in the past three years going ahead investors should switch to private sector banks. The broking firm sees a less promising trajectory for staterun banks as they struggle with weaker deposit growth and much lower liquidity buffers resulting in a weaker earnings growth compared to private banks.Bernstein said that the liquidity headroom is a lot lower than what the loantodeposit ratio might suggest given the higher investments for public banks are a result of higher deposits and cannot be reduced to be on par with private banks.Aggressive pricing in loans and deposits by public banks is forcing a growthmargin tradeoff that will result in muted earnings growth. So even if public sector banks squeeze out the remaining liquidity buffers to match growth the higher loan growth will not translate into earnings growth said Bernstein.The brokerage firm said that with the recent rally the market cap to preprovision operating profit (PPOP) ratio for public banks is more than 0.6X that of private banks despite their deposit growth rates remaining less than 0.6X of private banks.Also Read   Pricevolume action in banking stocks signal resurgence  PSU lenders outperform "
