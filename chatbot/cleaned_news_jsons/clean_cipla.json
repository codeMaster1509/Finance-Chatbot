    "The benchmark Nifty ended just above 22500 marking a flat weekly close on April 12. While the weekly chart shows little change reverting to the previous week s close the daily chart reveals a notable hesitancy at higher levels.Prices have precisely retreated from the upper boundary of the  rising channel  pattern a formation we highlighted earlier during the week. Accompanied by a   twopoint negative divergence  on the RSIsmoothened indicator a cautious approach is advisable for bulls camp at higher levels.Traders should refrain from chasing buying opportunities at elevated levels and are encouraged to consider profitbooking on any bounce back. Notably the range of 22700 to 22800 presents significant resistance.Conversely key indices hover slightly above their previous swing high technically considered as a support level. For the Nifty this lies within the range of 22450 to 22500 and a breach may trigger further profitbooking potentially towards 22300 and beyond in the near term.
