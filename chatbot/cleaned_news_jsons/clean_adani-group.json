    "Nifty took investors on a wild ride this week as it climbed steadily throughout the week but surrendered most of its gains on April 12 due to concerns about rising US inflation delay in interest rate cuts and heightened geopolitical tensions. The coming week will be crucial for the market as fresh worries regarding the IsraelIran conflict emerge.Iran launched its first direct attack on Israel with explosive drones and missiles on April 13 raising a threat to security and peace in the Gulf region. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that Israel has been preparing for a direct attack by Iran.The event also garnered attention from leaders around the globe. Any significant escalation in tensions may incite panic selling and heighten volatility in global stock markets said analysts.Also Read   IsraelIran tensions  How should investors navigate the impact on financial market In the upcoming holidaytruncated week investors will be watching for developments in the Middle East. Here are some stocks that will remain in focus due to escalating tensions between Israel and Iran.1. Adani Ports  Adani Ports owns the Haifa port in northern Israel. It completed the purchase in January 2024 for about US  1.03 billion and operates the port with a local partner. Although the war has not yet impacted the port in any way a broader escalation in the conflict could make critical infrastructure within Israel such as this port a potential target.2. Sun Pharma  Sun Pharma s subsidiary Taro is an Israeli firm. If some of the staff is potentially called for active duty in the war it could impact production to an extent but it is unlikely to have a big impact on Sun Parma s overall consolidated financials.3. OMC stocks  If the IranIsrael conflict deepens it is expected to drive crude prices higher to potentially hitting  100 per barrel in the near future. This may directly hit the stock of Oil Market Companies (OMCs) such as Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL).These scrips may see increased volatility as higher crude prices not only put pressure on marketing margins but also lead to a rise in working capital requirements since OMCs import crude oil to meet the country s petroleum products demand. As crude prices rise they need to spend more on imports.4. Paint Stocks  Whenever crude oil prices go up the paint sector is hit hard as the main inputs in the manufacture of paints are crude oil derivatives. These companies have no control over these input prices.If tensions in the Middle East escalate pushing crude price to above  100 per barrel stocks of paint manufacturers like Akzo Nobel India Berger Paints Indigo Paints and Shalimar Paints may come under pressure as crude derivatives account for almost 40 percent of the input bill for these paint manufacturers. A rise in the price of crude can mean narrower profit margins.Also Read   IsraelIran escalating tension to trigger correction in equities  Check Nifty Bank Nifty levels to watch5. Tyre stocks  Since the tyre industry uses crude oil derivatives for manufacturing synthetic rubber several tyre stocks including MRF CEAT Apollo Tyres JK Tyres and Goodyear Tire   Rubber India will remain in focus as a rise in crude price will hit their margins.",

(AEML) to stable from negative while affirming their credit ratings.Regulatory investigations done by the market regulator SEBI and Supreme Court have mostly concluded without proving wrongdoing on alleged governance matters raised in a shortseller report released in January 2023. The report alleged noncompliance of minimum public shareholding nondisclosures of related party transactions or stock price manipulation among others. All allegations were denied by Adani Group. The stable outlook reflects strong business fundamentals and robust cash flows for AEML and APSEZ in the next 12 to 24 months. We also expect the rated entities to not undertake significant relatedparty transactions outside the normal course of business  said S P Global in a release.S P said it believes the conclusion of most regulatory investigations into the Adani Group without evidence of wrongdoing has reduced downside risk. It added though that the group remains exposed to some governance risks as part of a large familyowned conglomerate with ambitious growth plans and relatedparty transactions.Repayment of all promoter loans linked to share prices equity and bank loans raised by multiple group entities at competitive rates reflects restored access to funding the rating agency said adding both companies enjoy good competitive positions healthy cash flows and adequate liquidity to meet their debtservicing requirements.Earlier this month the Supreme Court of India issued a judgement confirming that Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) had completed its investigation of 22 of the 24 allegations against the Adani portfolio entities without any adverse findings.
