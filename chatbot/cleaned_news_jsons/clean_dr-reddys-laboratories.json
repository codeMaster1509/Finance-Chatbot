    "It appears that the week ended February 9 was characterised by significant volatility with the India VIX reading again surpassing 15 and closing near 15.5 on a weekly scale. This suggests that market participants should brace for potentially heightened volatility in the week beginning February 12.Regarding the Nifty index despite attempting to break the alltime high of around 22126.80 the index failed to do so and reversed from approximately 22053 closing below the 21800 mark with a weekly loss of around 0.33 percent. This indicates some resistance at the alltime high level.Looking ahead to the current week it s crucial for traders to closely monitor the 21500 level which is identified as a significant support level. A breach of this level could potentially trigger panic in the market.On the upside if the Nifty index manages to sustain above 21700 there s a possibility of it retesting the 22000 22100 levels. This suggests that traders should keep a close eye on the key support and resistance levels and remain flexible in their trading strategies.Bank NiftyIt seems that despite a significant rebound from the 200day exponential moving average (DEMA) the Bank Nifty closed the week with a 0.73 percent loss indicating some selling pressure. However observing a bullish Bat pattern on a daily scale suggesting potential upward momentum in the near term.The Bank Nifty needs to hold the support of 45000 in the current week. If the index manages to sustain above 45000 there s a possibility of it testing the 46500 level indicating further bullish movement.Conversely a failure to maintain support at 45000 could lead to additional selling pressure potentially pushing the Bank Nifty down to the next support level of 44500. The presence of a bullish trendline from the October 26 2023 low of 42800 further supports the idea of a potential upward trend in the Bank Nifty.Here are three buy calls for short term Dr Reddy s Laboratories  Buy   LTP  Rs 6156   StopLoss  Rs 5850   Target  Rs 6675   Return  8 percentThe past few months have been good for the pharma stocks since the index Nifty Pharma surged over 20 percent from the bottom of 14600.

However the contribution from the blockbuster cancer drug Revlimid is expected to remain stable offsetting the loss of revenue from other segments.The pharma major had posted a topline of Rs 6789.80 crore in the yearago period.Among the brokerage estimates collated by   JM Financial rolled out the most bearish growth projections for Dr Reddy s Q3 performance while YES Securities was the most optimistic.Revlimid contribution remains steady others not so muchThe generic version of the cancer drug Revlimid will continue to remain the star contributor to the drugmaker s US revenue for yet another quarter with analysts estimating its contribution to come to around  100 million for Q3.

    "Pharmaceutical major Dr Reddy s Laboratories delivered betterthanexpected Q2 results backed by strong contribution from the blockbuster cancer drug Revlimid and higher other income from benefits from the government s productionlinked incentives.However brokerages see the drugmaker s high dependence on Revlimid increased focus on inorganic growth and expensive valuations as major headwinds for Dr Reddy s.Brokerage firm Noumra attributed Dr Reddy s betterthanexpected Q2 results to higher nonrecurring income due to a litigation settlement income of Rs 98.4 crore higher grants from the PLI scheme (at Rs 160 crore against a quarterly average of Rs 75 crore) along with better US revenues thanks to resilient Revlimid sales.

EBITDA margin also expanded to 31.7 percent in JulySeptember as against 30.6 percent in the base period.However much of the company s strong profitability in Q2 was on account of sales of highmargin Revlimid.  Excluding it margins are subpar at 20 percent. We identify the reserves that Revlimid can generate to fund inorganic growth and R D but that also exposes it to margin and return risks postRevlimid  Nuvama Institutional Equities mentioned in a note.The drugmaker is also extensively exploring opportunities of inorganic growth to compensate for the loss of Revlimid contribution from FY26. But Nuvama believes that it might not be a smooth sail as Dr Reddy s core business remains under threat and runs the risk of returns tapering down.On that account Nuvama has a  reduce  call on Dr Reddy s with a price target of Rs 4670.Follow our live blog for all the market actionInvestec also believes that increased investments depressed Dr Reddy s nearterm EPS excluding Revlimid. On the other side Investec also sees the company generating significant cash flow from Revlimid sales which helps it to evaluate better inorganic opportunities that could possibly lead to higher growth in the long run.

    "Pharmaceutical major Dr Reddy s Laboratories is expected to report a healthy jump in net profit on the back of a decent sales growth when it announce its JulySeptember quarter earnings on October 27.The Hyderabadbased company s revenue is expected to see high singledigit onyear growth as it continues to benefit from the robust sales of the blockbuster cancer drug Revlimid in the US.According to a poll of brokerages collated by   Dr Reddy s is likely to report a net profit of Rs 1481.80 crore up 34.7 percent from a year ago. Its revenue is expected to be at Rs 6945.10 crore rising 9.6 percent from the same quarter of the previous fiscal.Sequential Dr Reddy s is likely to see a cooling of Revlimid sales and weakness in the domestic market. The company delivered a topline of Rs 6757.90 crore and a bottomline of Rs 1400.70 crore in the previous quarter.US growth to hold up in Q2Growth in Dr Reddy s US business is expected to remain resilient as sales Revlimid remain strong when compared to peers despite some moderation. A rampup of Nuvaring a contraception ring constipation drug Amitiza Suboxone which is used to treat opioid use disorder Vascepa that reduces the risk of heart attack and stroke and Remoduli which is for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension will also aid US sales.Brokerage firm Philip Capital has forecast strong US sales for Dr Reddy s at  355 million led by the continued benefit of Revlimid pegged at nearly  100 million and integration of acquired Mayne Pharma s operation with sales of over  25 million.India business weak A slowdown in the domestic pharma market due lower offtake in acute sales on the back of a sporadic monsoon and slower uptick in viral infections is likely to weigh down Dr Reddy s growth in the domestic market.Brokerage firm Nuvama Institutional Equities sees Dr Reddy s India business delivering a mere 5 percent growth onyear due to a season of weak socalled acute season as well as lost sales from divested brands.Acute therapies are antiinfective drugs but because monsoon was sporadic and late this year these infections didn t see a spike impacting sale of acute drugs.Other markets like Europe and Russia are expected to deliver doubledigit growth in Q2.Pressure on margins likelyThe moderation in sales of highmargin drug Revlimid and a change in product mix is expected to be a major drag on Dr Reddy s profitability sequentially.According to Kotak Institutional Equities a sequential decline of 80 basis points (bps) in gross margins and 220 (bps) in the EBITDA margin is likely . The firm also expects consolidated EBITDA to grow 3 percent on year to Rs 1950 crore.EBITDA is short for earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation.

In the previous trading session it took out the said range and is currently placed near Rs 5700 mark.The best part about this consolidation is that it consolidated near 50 DEMA (the daily exponential moving average).

At the current juncture maintaining a cautious approach would be the need of the hour due to the following reasons   The current price action on the weekly chart is way above the Ichimoku cloud which is a matter of concern.  Rs 662 levels will be stiff resistance since it is the 0.618 retracement point of the 2018 January high of 888.  The weekly ADX (average directional index) line is way above both DMI s which might call for some booking at the counter.Thus book profit in the zone of Rs 660 675 and avoid fresh longs.",

    "With Cipla s promoters the Hamieds looking out for potential buyers to divest their stake one of the biggest India Inc takeovers is brewing.Cipla s peers and private equity firms including Blackstone and Baring Asia are said to be jostling for the pharma jewel. While Torrent Pharma a smaller rival has emerged as a frontrunner on the other side Dr Reddy s Labs was reportedly approached by Bain Capital to make a joint bid for Cipla.The promoters currently own a 33.47 percent stake in Cipla which means acquiring their stake would trigger a mandatory open offer for an additional 26 percent stake potentially resulting in the buyer holding majority ownership of up to 59.47 percent in Cipla. Considering Cipla s current market capitalisation this transaction would carry a substantial value of over  7 billion making it the biggest deal in the Indian pharmaceutical sector.The news of the acquisition has also set in motion a slew of speculations over who could win the battle and what the future may look like for Cipla.Given that the deal will likely take place at Cipla s current market price (CMP) analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities (KIE) feel that the ability of PE investors to derive a healthy internal rate of return (IRR) could be constrained. Hence they see a higher possibility of a strategic investor acquiring Cipla is higher at its CMP.Brushing aside the idea of PE investors taking over Cipla leaves two candidates in the race   Torrent Pharma and Dr Reddy s.How will the economics work out for Torrent Pharma and Dr Reddy s The fact that Torrent Pharma is eyeing a majority stake in a company which is 2.5 times its size in sales is remarkable and daunting at the same time. While Torrent does have an impeccable track record of acquisitions in the recent past like that of Elder Pharma Unichem Labs and most recently Curatio Healthcare some analysts also have concerns about the risks that the debt burden may bring for the company.A common thread tying together Torrent Pharma and Dr Reddy s in their quest to take over Cipla is the consequent rise in their nearterm debt levels. Assuming the deal happens at CMP the buyer would need  7.3 billion to acquire Cipla promoters  entire stake and complete the 26 percent open offer (assuming 100 percent subscription).If Torrent wins the race foreign brokerage Jefferies believes that the company will be used as a vehicle to acquire Cipla rather than the former s promoters buying out the latter s promoters stake. KIE also does not consider the possibility of Torrent s or Dr Reddy s promoters directly acquiring Cipla as that would significantly limit any synergy benefits.With the assumption that Torrent Pharma can raise equity from promoters PE or other equity investors worth  2.82.9 billion to the extent that their promoter stake dilutes to 51 percent from the current 71 percent it will still need to raise debt to fulfil the remaining  4 billion. This would take Torrent s debttoEBITDA to 3.5 times.As for Dr Reddy s the debttoEBITDA is likely to come around 1.5 times based on the same calculations. Based on these assumptions KIE expects a 7 percent and 4 percent earningsperstock dilution in FY25 earnings for Torrent Pharma and Dr Reddy s respectively if either acquires Cipla.Irrespective of which firm manages to gain control over Cipla Jefferies believes that the combined entity will generate considerable free cash flows and hence both companies in the race should be able to handle the stretched balance sheet.Some pockets in the market also have a contrarian take on this. YES Securities for example believes that the Cipla deal would be an upfront negative for Torrent s ROCE (Return on Capital Employed) ROE (Return on Equity) which coupled with the debt burden would have a bearing on their view if at all it becomes a reality.Also Read   Cipla s stake change  different scenarios for the investor Regardless analysts at KIE feel that a higher promoter shareholding in Torrent Pharma (71.25 percent as against 26.7 percent in Dr Reddy s) provides the company with a higher flexibility as it gives another avenue for fundraising for the promoters.With that said culturally it is Cipla and Dr Reddy s that are more aligned with each other.  Unlike Cipla and Dr Reddy s where the involvement of promoters in daytoday operations is limited the promoter family is actively involved in the daytoday operations of Torrent Pharma  KIE noted.Nonetheless the takeover of Cipla by either of the two companies will lead to the emergence of a merged entity that will be a market leader in the domestic pharma market.Limited portfolio overlaps a trigger for future growthAnother common thread tying Torrent Pharma and Dr Reddy s is the limited overlap of less than 3 percent and 7 percent market share with Cipla respectively in their domestic portfolios. KIE noted that the combined market shares of brands in an overlapping molecule are in the range of 118 percent and 122 percent for Torrent Pharma and Dr Reddy s respectively which limits the risk of divestments.The India business was the biggest contributor for both Cipla and Torrent in FY23 while the North American market seized the deal for Dr Reddy s.Coming to the international market there is barely any overlap in the portfolios of Cipla and Torrent Pharma. However there is a slightly higher overlap for Dr Reddy s especially within international markets specifically in US generics which brokerages believe is unlikely to yield meaningful synergies.Cipla and Torrent Pharma   what are the synergies Cipla s robust presence in South Africa complements Torrent Pharma s strong presence in Brazil KIE highlighted. In emerging markets getting product registrations and establishing an  on the ground  presence is difficult and hence Jefferies believes that for the combined entity crossselling of products in target emerging markets can lead to faster scaleup of operations.In the domestic market Torrent has a strong presence in cardiac neuro vitamins and minerals while Cipla is welloiled in respiratory and antiinfective segments. Cipla also has a wellestablished trade in the generics segment (about 20 percent of India sales) and a recently established Consumer Health division.YES Securities seconded the view as it believes Cipla and Torrent s complementary presence would also bring a larger US business into the latter s fold a notsokeen geography for its management.According to brokerage firm IIFL Securities Cipla s acquisition would make a great strategic fit for Torrent as it would catapult the merged entity to a numero uno position in the Indian market strengthen its acute portfolio particularly in therapies of respiratory and antiinfectives and also provide access to Cipla s diversified US pipeline of inhalation and complex injectables.Cipla and Dr Reddy s   what does the merged entity look like The case is completely different for Dr Reddy s as it has a slightly higher domestic and international overlap with Cipla. However unlike Torrent Pharma where there is a meaningful difference in scale KIE does not expect any major operational challenges for Dr Reddy s in managing Cipla s US operations considering its US business is about 1.7 times that of Cipla s in the segment.As for other geographies Dr Reddy s has a prominent presence in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). However Cipla has a negligible presence in this region. Both these companies are active in Europe which could provide some scope for rationalisation in the region KIE believes.Moreover there is one space where neither Dr Reddy s nor Cipla have a marked presence that is biosimilars and specialty where peer Sun Pharma leads. Based on that KIE feels the combined entity will have a higher ability to pursue biosimilars and specialty forays in developed markets.Also Cipla s acquisition would propel Dr Reddy s into a leader in the domestic pharma market aligned with its stated ambition of being among the top five players in India.Overall KIE sees synergies for both Torrent and Dr Reddy s with Cipla driven by the rationalisation of Medical Representative costs marketing and promotional expenses as well as the optimisation of corporate and manufacturing overheads.Despite the various permutations and combinations being put out the deal is yet to reach its course. And the ball can land in anyone s court.Also Read   Why PE firms may find Cipla acquisition a different ball game",
