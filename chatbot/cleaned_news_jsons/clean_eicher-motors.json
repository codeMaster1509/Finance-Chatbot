Hence we advise investors to prioritise the largecap stocks and quality midcap stocks for the coming few weeks as they offer a better riskreward proposition along with a higher degree of safety around the elections.Talking about levels the 10day as well as 20day EMA zone of 2238022430 will act as crucial resistance on the upside. Any sustainable rebound rally could be seen only on crossover above the 22430 levels on the Nifty Spot. Above 22430 the Nifty may once again rally up to the 2275022800 levels. On the downside immediate support zones are placed at 21950 followed by the 2175021700 zone.Here are three buy calls for short term Amara Raja Energy   Mobility  Buy   LTP  Rs 968   StopLoss  Rs 900   Target  Rs 1070 1100   Return  14 percentOn Tuesday the stock of Amara Raja Energy   Mobility has given major longterm downward sloping trendline breakout.

    "Volatile trade ruled the market through the week ended March 22 with a slight positive note of 0.3 percent rise in Nifty at the time of settling down a tad below 22100 levels.There has been a strong show of tugofwar between the counterparties to exhibit their presence though no conducive settlement was seen portraying tentativeness in the market. The Nifty still hovers within the 20day and 50day exponential moving average (DEMA) on the daily chart indicating uncertainty. However the recent low signifies a lower low formation on the daily timeframe and a further correction below the same could indicate the inception of a bearish trend in the markets.For now 2190021850 is likely to cushion any shortterm blip with major focus on a swing low of 21700 breaching which disruption on chart structure could be seen in the current truncated week. On the higher end 2220022250 is expected to act as an intermediate hurdle and an authoritative closure above the same could only bring some mojo back into the market.As we head for a truncated week with just three trading sessions and monthly expiry it would be crucial to track global developments to have an immediate effect on the markets. Also a spike in volatility is anticipated keeping expiry in view. Hence it is advisable to maintain caution and stay fussy with stock selection for an outperformance in the market.Here are three buy calls for the short term Apollo Hospitals Enterprise  Buy   LTP  Rs 6375.90   StopLoss  Rs 6100   Target  Rs 66506770   Return  6 percentApollo Hospitals has witnessed a decent correction of over 13 percent in the recent period from the lifetime high zone retracting towards the neckline of the breakout on the weekly time frame. After a couple of weeks of consolidation the stock has regained strength and reverted towards the primary trend on the back of notable volumes indicating an opportunity to go long.The technical indicators are very much in line with the bullish development adding a strong undertone to the counter. Hence we recommend buying Apollo Hospitals around Rs 63706350 with a stoploss of Rs 6100 and target of Rs 66506770.Eicher Motors  Buy   LTP  Rs 3988.40   StopLoss  Rs 3800   Target  Rs 41804200   Return  5 percentEicher Motors witnessed a strong spurt in pricevolume in the last trading week from the cluster of its significant EMAs and made a strong runaway gap.

    "Shares of Eicher Motors Limited jumped over percent 4 percent in the morning trade on March 20 after global brokerage UBS upgraded its rating to  buy  with as much as 35 percent upside citing the company s new launches and lacklustre performance from peers.At 9.50 am Eicher Motors stock was at Rs 3863 up 4 percent from the previous close. UBS analysts have raised their price target on Eicher Motors stock to Rs 5000 implying an upside of 34.5 percent from the last close.Despite being aggressively priced the launches by Harley Davidson and Bajaj Auto s triumph failed to increase volume significantly. As of February 2024 Harley and Triumph s cumulative volume of the models launched stood at around 4000 units well below the expected guidance.Follow our live blog for all the market actionUBS believes that even as competitors have entered the market aiming to challenge Eichers  dominance none of them have been able to make a significant impact on customers. Rivals have also attempted to outdo Royal Enfield with better specifications and aggressive pricing but haven t been able to match Royal Enfield s qualitative and emotive edge.  These aspects are challenging for competitors to replicate. As per SIAM data the company s market share in the premium motorcycle segment has risen despite competition. Figures show that its market share in Q2FY23 stood at 42 percent and increased to 45 percent in Q3FY24.Not just that the company is also planning to launch a new bike  Roadster. Analysts believe that the launch will bridge the performance gap previously seen when compared to the likes of Harley Davidson and Triumph. This new model offers industryleading performance especially featuring Royal Enfield s first liquidcooled engine anticipated to address concerns regarding engine heating in hot conditions and heavy traffic.  We believe the upcoming 450cc roadster potentially followed by additional body forms will stimulate replacement demand among Royal Enfield s 350cc customers.  UBS said in a note.On exports the brokerage anticipates a strong rebound in exports for FY25FY26 led by the rampup of the Himalayan 450 the introduction of additional 650cc models and a recovery in demand across specific endmarkets. UBS projections indicate a 25 percent growth in export demand during FY2526 contrasting with the 23 percent decline observed in FY24. We expect Eicher Motors to outperform the industry on volume growth over the medium term. It continues to have a strong launch pipeline while most key competitors have already launched products  UBS said. It is also expected that Eichers  average selling price will outpace the industry when considering the launch of its new 450cc platform (which could be at a 2030 percent premium to 350cc series motorcycles) and multiple 650cc launches.",
