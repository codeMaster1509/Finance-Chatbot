    " It would be very difficult for Nifty 50 to surpass Friday s high of 22795 in the coming week. Even if it does then we expect 22900   22950 to be a very strong hurdle  Mehul Kothari DVP   Technical Research at Anand Rathi Shares   Stock Brokers said in an interview to  .Along with the trendline breakout Coal India has also confirmed an ascending triangle breakout above Rs 465 mark. Hence the stock is poised for a new life high above Rs 482 he believes.Kothari who has around 15 years of work experience in technical research is bullish on Balrampur Chini Mills and DCM Shriram for the coming week.Technically are you bullish on Coal India that has seen a resistance trendline breakout Along with the trendline breakout Coal India has also confirmed an ascending triangle breakout above the Rs 465 mark. Hence the stock seems to be poised for a new life high above Rs 482. However the theoretical target for the pattern stands around Rs 500 and more whereas the support is placed at Rs 450.Do you expect BHEL to hit record high of around Rs 400 in the coming weeks That would be too much to ask for in a shortterm time frame. It is because BHEL has rallied nonstop over the past five quarters. Since the year 2023 the stock has rallied almost 5X from the low of Rs 66. Thus we expect some profit booking postelection in this stock. For long term the view remains positive.Do you think the Nifty is likely to give a breakout of current consolidation on the higher side and surpass the 23000 mark next week It would be very difficult for Nifty 50 to surpass Friday s high of 22795.

Thus without the participation of banking stocks it would be a real test for the bulls in the coming week. On the downside immediate support is placed at Friday s low of 22348 followed by the 22200 mark.Is it better to stay away from Nifty IT index for the time being or is it the right time to take exposure to the space The index has already corrected around 15 percent in past one and a half month and there is no confirmation as of now for a bounce.For the coming week 31900 can be the next support for the index which is a 78.6 percent retracement of the previous move.

Along with breaking the range the stock also confirmed a trendline breakout above the placement of its 200 DEMA (days exponential moving average).Due to the selloff in the markets the stock has again retested the breakout zone and looks lucrative for long with a shortterm time frame.Thus we advise traders to go long in the stock near Rs 390 with a stoploss of Rs 379 for the upside target of Rs 412 in the coming week.DCM ShriramAs of now the stock is consolidating just above its 200 DEMA after a rally from Rs 900 levels.
