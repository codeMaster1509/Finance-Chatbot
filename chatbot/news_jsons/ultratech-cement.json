    "UltraTech Cement is set to present its earnings report for the first fiscal quarter of FY25 on July 19. Sequentially, India's largest grey cement, ready mix concrete and white cement manufacturer is expected to deliver a subpar performance in Q1FY25 despite a rise in volumes, primarily due to weak prices, and a decline in average realisations that will impact earnings.According to a Moneycontrol poll, UltraTech Cement's net profit\u00a0is expected to slump 30 percent QoQ to Rs 1,733 crore. Revenue is also seen falling 13 percent sequentially to Rs 17,962 crore.On a year-on-year basis, however, net profit and revenue are seen rising 2.5 percent, and 1.3 percent, respectively.The most optimistic estimate sees Ultratech Cement's net profit rising 19 percent on-year, respectively. But the most pessimistic projection suggests that net profit might sink eight percent YoY.What factors are driving the earnings?Demand Slowdown: The slowdown in construction activities during the general elections in April and May adversely impacted cement sales in these months. Scorching heat, labour shortages, and unseasonal rain in some regions further dented demand during Q1FY25.Muted prices: Cement prices entered Q1F25 with a steep hike announcement in some regions, but with lower-than-historical average demand and a sudden ramp-up of M&As among large players, sustaining any price hike became impossible. Hikes implemented in April were reversed during May and June due to soft demand and stiff competition.Decline in realisations: According to analysts at Motilal Oswal, blended realization is likely to decline around three percent YoY. Price realisation in cement refers to the average revenue a company earns per unit sold. It helps gauge the average income per ton, with higher realisation indicating better profitability per unit.High Costs: The cement maker's depreciation/interest expenses are estimated to increase up to eight percent on-year likely causing a negative operating leverage, which occurs when a company's fixed costs are high, causing profits to decline disproportionately as sales decrease.Combined with lower price realisations, this can significantly hamper net earnings.According to analysts at BOBCAPS, UltraTech Cement's growth stayed at a higher single digit after a very strong Q4FY24 as the company focuses on retaining prices at relatively better levels than its peers.\"Volume growth of around 8.5 percent is despite strong competition from the peer set. Operating efficiencies likely to move margins into positive territory,\" it said.What to look out for in the quarterly show?Analysts will be keeping a close eye on management commentary on the demand scenario amidst a seasonally weak quarter, price sustainability amidst intensifying competition, and consolidation in the sector.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "Sharekhan's research report on UltraTech CementUltratech\u2019s board recently approved making a financial investment to purchase up to 7.06 crore equity shares of The India Cements at a price up to Rs. 267 per share constituting a 23% stake in India Cements. The transaction is valued at Rs. 1885 crore valuing India Cements at an EV/tonne of $90/tonne. As of now, an open offer is not triggered as it does not breach 25% stake. However, further stake acquisitions to control majority ownership in India Cements cannot be ruled out. The investment follows the recent acquisition of Penna Cements by Ambuja and can be viewed as Ultratech\u2019s strategic move to secure its regional and market leadership.OutlookUltraTech is well poised to benefit from a strong demand environment led by government spending on infrastructure and rising demand from the housing sector. Industry consolidation, structural demand drivers and softening fuel prices provide operational profitability growth tailwinds. Although, movement of cement prices would remain a key monitorable in the near to medium term. Currently, we have not factored in India Cements stake acquisition in our financials awaiting further clarity on its future plans with respect to further stake acquisitions. At CMP, the stock is trading at an EV/EBITDA of 22.8x/18.5x its FY2025E/FY2026E earnings, which we believe provides further room for upside. Hence, considering its long-term growth potential, we maintain our Buy rating on the stock, with a revised PT of Rs. 13,000 owing to strong earnings growth outlook over FY2024-FY2026E.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

    "The Street cheered Ultratech Cement's acquisition of a 23 percent stake in Chennai-based India Cements for Rs 1,889 crore, pushing the stock to a record high of Rs 11,875 per share on June 27. Analysts predict this deal could lead to a larger stake purchase and establish a new 'Thalaiva' (dominant player) in the Southern market.This move came two weeks after the Adani Group's Ambuja Cements announced its acquisition of Penna Cements, a South India-based company, for Rs 10,422 crore.Investec analysts noted that Ultratech's acquisition could boost its capacity share in South India from 11 percent to 18 percent, particularly enhancing its presence in Telangana, where it previously had no operations.ALSO READ:\u00a0Moneycontrol Pro Panorama | UltraTech cements its no1 positionIndia Cements currently has a cement production capacity of 14.5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) and a clinker capacity of 11.13 MTPA. This complements Ultratech's existing capacities in the South, which include 2 MTPA in Telangana, 5 MTPA in Tamil Nadu, and 10.6 MTPA in Andhra Pradesh.CLSA analysts view this transaction as a strategic entry point for Ultratech, likely to increase industry consolidation and pricing power. Meanwhile, BofA analysts suggest that the investment could enhance Ultratech's market prospects in the South, potentially leading to a majority stake in the future.Ultratech, India's largest cement producer, acquired 70.5 million shares of India Cements at an average price of Rs 268 each from Radhakishan Damani and related entities in two block deals. Despite speculation of a hostile takeover, Ultratech described the purchase as a 'non-controlling financial investment.'Tushar Chaudhari, a research analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher, commented that the deal could benefit both companies.

    "UltraTech Cement, the crown jewel of the Kumar Mangalam Birla group, plans to acquire 23 percent in India Cements for up to Rs 1,890 crore. The deal involves purchasing 70.6 million shares of India Cements at Rs 267 each. This transaction, described by UltraTech as a \"non-controlling financial investment,\" is expected to be finalised within a month, according to a stock exchange filing.Read:\u00a0Potential hostile takeover by UltraTech brewing in India Cements?Here\u2019s a snapshot of how the two cement companies fared in terms of key financial metrics and stock performance.India Cements earningsThe company reported its fifth consecutive quarterly loss in the March 2024 quarter, with revenue continuing to decline year-on-year for the fourth straight quarter. The company, ranked tenth largest in the cement sector, is grappling with working capital shortages. This has been exacerbated by intense price competition following the Adani Group's entry into the industry through the acquisition of Ambuja Cements Ltd and ACC Ltd in 2022.As of March 2024, all shares held by promoters, led by managing director N Srinivasan, were pledged with banks, up from 45 percent at the end of December 2023. In response to these challenges, India Cements has been actively taking steps to alleviate its working capital constraints, including asset sales. The company's Q4 performance reflects these efforts, showing some improvement according to experts.The management anticipates significant relief in working capital following the recent sale of non-core and core assets such as land and a grinding plant. They have expressed cautious optimism regarding demand and pricing trends and clarified their intention not to sell further core assets for business funding, focusing instead on operational efficiencies. The management has sounded confident about resolving working capital issues and improving business operations in the coming quarters. But analysts remain watchful given the company's historical performance relative to peers. ultra vs india cementUltraTech Cement earningsIndia\u2019s largest cement manufacturer reported a strong revenue growth in Q4, driven by robust demand across key markets. Improved operating leverage, favorable fuel prices, and effective cost controls contributed to margin expansion.UltraTech Cement is aggressively pursuing acquisitions to achieve its ambitious target of increasing capacity from 147 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) to 200 mtpa. In December 2023, the company announced the acquisition of Kesoram Industries' cement assets for Rs 7,600 crore. This transaction, awaiting regulatory approvals in 2-3 quarters, includes two integrated cement units in Karnataka and Telangana with a total grinding capacity of 10.75 million tonnes (MT). Additionally, UltraTech expanded into Jharkhand through the acquisition of Burnpur Cement, adding 0.5 MT grinding capacity.In FY24, UltraTech invested around Rs 9,200 crore in capital expenditures, increasing its domestic manufacturing capacity to about 141 MT (excluding Kesoram). The company plans to maintain a similar capex run-rate next year and aims to achieve a total capacity of around 157 MT by March 2025.Analysts expected strong demand for cement from from rural and infrastructure sectors, alongside increasing orders from urban real estate. The management is optimistic about a prolonged favorable demand environment in the cement sector.UltraTech's expansion plans for phases 2 (22.6 mtpa) and 3 (21.9 mtpa) are progressing as scheduled, aiming for completion by FY2027. Coupled with the acquisition of Kesoram (10.75 mtpa), this will elevate its total cement capacity to 195.4 mtpa (including overseas capacities). UltraTech is well-positioned to capitalise on the expanding cement demand expected over the next 4-5 years, with a positive outlook on profitability and balance sheet strength. ultra vs india cementStock price performanceIn 2023, UltraTech Cement significantly outperformed India Cement in terms of stock performance. However, this year both stocks are closely aligned, with each gaining around 11 percent.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "The announcement by UltraTech Cement to acquire a 23 percent stake in India Cements has sparked discussions about a potential hostile takeover.The acquisition of shares in the South India-based cement maker will place UltraTech\u00a0in a significant position within India Cements, a company long associated with its owner N Srinivasan who, along with other promoter group members, holds only a 28.42 percent stake.The Stakes and the PlayersAs the largest manufacturer of cement in India, the Kumar Mangalam Birla-led UltraTech's move can be seen as a calculated effort to consolidate its dominance in the market. On the other hand, India Cements, with its historical significance and strong market presence, represents a valuable addition to any portfolio.Srinivasan, a prominent figure in the Indian cement industry and the vice-chairman and managing director of India Cements, now finds himself in a delicate position. With less than 29 percent stake, his control over the company is vulnerable. The difference between UltraTech\u2019s newly acquired 23\u00a0percent stake and Srinivasan\u2019s stake is slim, heightening the possibility of a power struggle.UltraTech\u2019s plans to pick up a major stake in India Cements comes at a time when its biggest rival in the cement industry - the Adani group - has been rapidly increasing its size and scale with acquisitions. Last week, Adani group announced that it will acquire Penna Cements for over Rs 10,000 crore, adding 10 million tonnes per annum capacity to its portfolio. Last year, it bagged\u00a0a controlling stake in Sanghi Cements.India Cements has a capacity of over 15.5 mtpa.Aditya Birla group itself became the biggest cement manufacturer in the country when it acquired UltraTech from L&T in 2004.While UltraTech in its stock exchange filing has labeled this stake purchase as a financial investment, analysts believe that the rationale behind the move could be to thwart the ambitions of any other corporate rival from making a acquisition move on India Cements.Large conglomerates such as Adani group and JSW group have been eyeing inorganic growth opportunities in the sector, where demand is expected to grow at a strong pace in the coming years, driven by rising infrastrudture spends by the Indian government and a revival of private sector capex.While UltraTech did not disclose the names of the India Cements shareholders from whom it intends to purchase the stake, the public shareholding of India Cements is dominated by three main investors with Dmart founder Radhakishan Damani holding the biggest chunk of 20.78 percent stake, followed by ELM Park Fund Ltd holding a 5.58 percent stake and LIC, which holds a 3.6 percent stake.As much as 20 percent equity stake in India Cements was sold in the block deal window on Thursday, 27 June.Hostile Takeover: A Real Possibility?A hostile takeover occurs when an acquiring company seeks to gain control of a target company against the wishes of its management. The relatively close stakes between UltraTech and Srinivasan suggest that UltraTech could potentially pursue this route. If UltraTech decides to increase its stake further, it might challenge Srinivasan\u2019s control and push for changes in the management and strategic direction of India Cements.While the acquisition of a 23 percent stake will not trigger a mandatory open offer of 26 percent from public shareholders, as the stake purchase is below the threshold of 25 percent needed to exercise control under Sebi regulations, UltraTech can go ahead and announce a open offer to acquire stake from the public shareholders if it intends to take over control of the company.Additionally, the broader context of the Indian cement industry should be considered. The sector has seen consolidation over the past few years, with major players looking to enhance their capacities and market share through acquisitions. UltraTech\u2019s recent move could be interpreted as part of this larger trend, positioning itself more favourably in an increasingly competitive market.The Road AheadThe coming months will be crucial in determining whether this acquisition will lead to a hostile takeover. Stakeholders and market analysts will be watching closely as both companies navigate this complex situation. For now, the possibility of a hostile takeover at India Cements remains speculative, but given the stakes and the players involved, it cannot be ruled out.Emails sent to UltraTech Cement, India Cements and Radhakishan Damani did not elicit a response till the time of publishing.\n       ",

    "India's infrastructure and capex boom through projects like the PM Gati Shakti is creating opportunities in the stock market as well, Morgan Stanley said, listing out key names that it is bullish on.Analysts at Morgan Stanley have cited Larsen & Toubro, NTPC, Titagarh Rail Systems and Ultratech Cement as among the key names benefitting from the government spend on infrastructure. The capex boom is also expected to dampen inflation, and boost corporate profitability, according to the analysts.A Morgan Stanley note informed investors that the momentum that India's infrastructure development has seen over the last decade is projected to continue. Analysts expect infrastructure investments to rise from 5.3 percent of GDP in FY24 to 6.5 percent of GDP by FY29, reflecting a robust 15.3 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR). This increase will result in cumulative spending of approximately $1.45 trillion over the next five years, the note said.This surge in infrastructure investment is expected to enhance overall investment rate and foster a period of sustained, high, productive growth.Follow our market blog to catch all the live actionBeneficiaries of India's infra push1. Larsen & Toubro (L&T)According to Morgan Stanley, increased government spend on infrastructure projects would likely benefit L&T significantly. Additionally, a moderation in steel and other material prices could improve the company\u2019s cost structure.An overall improvement in the economy, leading to higher-than-anticipated private capex, would also be a positive driver for L&T.However, a slowdown in government-led infrastructure capex is a key risk for the company's prospects, so is a slowdown in the\u00a0execution cycle which could hamper project completion and profitability. Geopolitical risks could lead to slower execution of projects, and a sharp increase in material costs could squeeze margins.2. NTPCAccording to Morgan Stanley, the potential upside for NTPC includes faster capacity addition driven by stronger power demand and improving health of State Electricity Boards (SEBs), value-accretive acquisitions, and value unlocking in subsidiaries.On the downside, risks involve delays in commissioning, fixed cost under-recovery due to coal or machine availability issues, investments in non-core businesses, and value-decreasing acquisitions.3. Titagarh Rail SystemsFor Titagarh Rail Systems, Morgan Stanley's base case is derived from a target P/E of 35x for September 2026 earnings. This multiple is considered fair, given strong earnings visibility from a large backlog and improving return ratios, which are the best among peers, the foreign brokerage said.An improvement in freight margins and a faster-than-expected ramp-up in passenger coach execution are significant positive drivers for Titagarh. Additionally, an acceleration in passenger segment margins beyond expectations would further enhance the company's financial performance, said analysts.Also Read |\u00a0Goldman Sachs has a Sell on Tata Tech, VinFast reliance a vulnerabilityHowever, supply chain issues could affect the freight business and hamper execution. A slowdown or delay in wagon tendering and ordering for passenger coaches could hurt operating margins.Additionally, delayed execution of contractual obligations could lead to liquidated damages, which would negatively affect the company's financial health.4. Ultratech CementMorgan Stanley believes that despite near-term uncertainties, the medium-term demand visibility for Ultratech Cement remains strong. The brokerage note\u00a0has identified several factors that could drive the stock's performance, including continued demand and a sharp decline in input prices.However, a weaker-than-expected demand offtake is possible if the macroeconomic situation worsens, and a rise in input prices could increase overall costs without corresponding higher realizations, thus denting company's profitability.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "The benchmark indices recorded a historic high and closed the session with gains exceeding 3 percent on June 3, with about 1,496 shares advancing and 825 shares declining on the NSE. The market sentiment is likely to be positive in the coming sessions. Here are some trading ideas for the near term.Mehul Kothari, DVP \u2013 Technical Research at Anand RathiDalmia Bharat | CMP: Rs 1,858After peaking near the Rs 2,060 mark on April 4, 2024, Dalmia Bharat experienced a significant downturn, with a decline of approximately 360 rupees, equating to roughly 17-18 percent. However, in the subsequent two trading sessions, Dalmia Bharat demonstrated resilience by avoiding further drops and instead reversed around the middle Bollinger band. Notably, in the prior trading session, there was considerable buying activity observed at lower price levels, suggesting investor interest in purchasing the stock at these levels.From a technical perspective, the daily DMI (Daily Movement Index) indicator has given a bull cross, indicating a potential shift in momentum and presenting an attractive buying opportunity. Consequently, traders are advised to consider buying Dalmia Bharat within the range of Rs 1,830-1,860, with an anticipated upside target of Rs 2,000 and a stop-loss placed at Rs 1,765 based on a daily closing price.Strategy: BuyTarget: Rs 2,000Stop-Loss: Rs 1,765UPL | CMP: Rs 528After a period of consolidation in the approximate range of Rs 505-530, UPL has successfully broken out of a bearish trendline that had persisted for five months.

From an indicator perspective, the weekly Stochastics has given a bull cross near 60 levels, which is a positive sign for potential gains.

    "Ultratech Cement posted strong revenue and profit in Q1, driven by double-digit volume growth and lower costs. However, declining prices were a concern due to erratic cement pricing across the country. The management expects subdued demand this fiscal year but does not anticipate a prolonged slowdown.The company reported strong financials, with consolidated net profit at Rs 2258 crore, up 36% YoY and 27% QoQ, and consolidated sales at Rs 20,419 crore, up 9.4% YoY and 22% QoQ. EBITDA stood at Rs 4,250 crore, up 25% QoQ and 23% YoY, with consolidated net debt at Rs 2,779 crore as of March 31.Domestic grey cement sales grew by 11% YoY and 31% sequentially to 33.22 million tonnes, while smaller segments\u00a0such as white cement and ready mix also saw growth; though cement exports dipped slightly.Brokerage viewsAfter the results, most brokerages maintained their ratings. Dolat Capital upgraded the stock to buy from accumulate, setting a revised target price of Rs 11,485 per share. Nuvama maintained a hold rating with a target price of Rs 10,024 per share. Jefferies India retained its buy rating but marginally lowered the target price to Rs 11,500 from Rs 11,560 per share.Nomura maintained a buy rating and raised the target price by 20\u00a0percent to Rs 12,000. B&K Securities also kept a buy rating with a target price of Rs 11,189 per share.Following are the analysts' notes on Ultratech Stock post earnings:Nomura: Ultratech aims to achieve a cement capacity of 200MT or more, with a projected growth to 183MT (excluding Kesoram) by FY27, representing a 9\u00a0percent CAGR from FY24-27. Phase 3 expansion plans include adding 22MT capacity at USD72/t with an estimated IRR of 15\u00a0percent. The company awaits regulatory approvals for the acquisition of Kesoram, which is expected to be completed by March 2025, taking Ultratech's capacity to over 190MT by FY27F. The management is confident about achieving the 200MT capacity organically.Despite recent price increases, lower consumption in the election quarter may lead to moderated prices, with a projected 1% sequential decline in blended realisation. Volume moderation in the election quarter may result in 7\u00a0percent higher fixed costs in 1QFY25F, leading to an expected moderation in EBITDA/t to Rs 1,080/t in 1QFY25F.Jefferies India: Ultratech's performance in the fourth quarter surpassed expectations, with EBITDA growing by 24\u00a0percent YoY and 26\u00a0percent QoQ. This was despite weak prices being balanced out by slightly better volumes (+11% YoY), increased other operating income, and reduced overheads.The management emphasised targeted cost savings of Rs 200-300 per ton in the medium term to drive profitability. We have adjusted our FY25 EBITDA estimate downward by 2\u00a0percent, but maintain our FY26 estimates. This adjustment is due to our revised expectation of flat price growth YoY (previously estimated at +1-2\u00a0percent YoY), anticipating margin expansion in FY25 as cost-saving initiatives from the second half of FY24 continue into FY25.Dolat Capital: Ultretech's capacity is set to increase from 146.2/152.7 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) in FY24/Q1FY25 to 162.4/184.9 mtpa by FY25E/FY26E. With additions like 10.75 mtpa from Kesoram and 5.4 mtpa from overseas, the total consolidated cement capacity will reach 199.6 mtpa by FY27E, supporting future growth. Healthy operating cash flow (averaging Rs 144.6 billion/year over FY24-FY26E) and free cash flow (averaging Rs 34.6 billion/year over FY24-FY26E) will lead to deleveraging.Ultratech, as the largest player in the Indian cement industry, has a significant advantage. Additionally, we anticipate issuing approximately 5.97 million new equity shares (2\u00a0percent) to Kesoram Industries' shareholders in FY26E.B&K Securities: Ultratech continued its double-digit volume growth for the second consecutive year, surpassing industry averages. Rapid capacity utilisation post-commissioning reflects strong brand and distribution. Despite short-term moderation, positive demand trend is expected due to a housing cycle upturn and ongoing infrastructure projects. Capacity growth aligns with industry trends, while cost efficiency measures enhance profitability outlook.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
