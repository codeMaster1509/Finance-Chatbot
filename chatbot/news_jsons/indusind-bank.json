    "By Rajesh Bhosale, technical analyst at Angel OneThe prominent highlight of the last week (ended May 10) was the increasing volatility (India VIX), which saw our markets experiencing significant price corrections despite favourable global cues. By the week's end, Nifty witnessed a deep cut of 1.87 percent, ending a tad above the 22,050 mark.Examining the weekly chart, it's evident that prices have been confined within a range for several weeks. This week, prices moved from the upper boundary to the lower one, signaling a notable shift in trader sentiment. The daily chart depicts a similar pattern, resembling a 'Rising Channel,' affirming a defined range for Indian markets.On Friday, prices managed to defend the lower boundary of this pattern, coinciding with the 89EMA (exponential moving average), preventing a breakdown. A comparable scenario occurred on April 19, where prices rebounded from this crucial support, eventually reaching a new high. While the previous move was supported by a strong 'Piercing Line' bullish candlestick pattern, this time it's an 'Inside Bar' pattern, still bullish but less significant.Additionally, the RSI (relative strength index) Smoothened has fallen below its previous swing low, indicating overall bleak conditions. Traders are advised not to be swayed by temporary rebounds and to maintain light positions until concrete signs of a bullish reversal emerge, especially with the impending Lok Sabha election results.Regarding levels, Thursday's low coinciding with the 89EMA at 21,900 serves as immediate support, followed by previous swing lows in the 21,800 - 21,700 range. On the upside, the zone between the 20 and 50EMA, around 22,200 - 22,300, presents a formidable obstacle.Here is one buy call and one sell recommendation for short term:Avenue Supermarts: Buy | LTP: Rs 4,797 | Stop-Loss: Rs 4,610 | Target: Rs 5,140 | Return: 7 percentOnce considered as a trader's delight, this stock has experienced a prolonged period of dormancy over the past year. However, there has been a recent technical breakthrough, with prices surpassing their previous swing high on the weekly chart, affirming a resurgence in the uptrend.Volumes analysis reveals heightened activity during upward movements compared to subdued volumes during declines, indicating accumulation in this particular counter.Furthermore, prices comfortably exceed key averages, with oscillators positioned positively, bolstering the buy signal. Despite a widespread market selloff, this stock has demonstrated relative strength, suggesting that its outperformance is poised to persist.Hence, we recommend buying Avenue Supermarts (D-Mart operator) around Rs 4,800 - 4,750, with a stop-loss of Rs 4,610 and target of Rs 5,140.IndusInd Bank: Sell | LTP: Rs 1,410 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,457 | Target: Rs 1,320 | Return: 6 percentAfter maintaining the key levels of Rs 1,430 for several months, prices have recently broken below it, signaling a bearish reversal pattern identified as the \"Inverse Cup and Handle\" pattern. This pattern suggests a bearish price cycle characterized by lower tops and lower bottoms.Additionally, the Smoothed RSI has fallen below its median level, indicating momentum favouring the bearish side. Given these parameters, it is anticipated that the stock may continue to decline in the near future.Hence, we recommend selling IndusInd Bank around Rs 1,410 - 1,415, with a stop-loss of Rs 1,457 and target of Rs 1,320.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

RoA remained strong at 1.9% for Q4FY24 as well as FY24. Gross slippages improved QoQ across subsegments, though the bank has part consumed contingent provisions. We believe IIB is well placed on growth, NIM and asset quality troika.

Its net profit (PAT) grew 15 percent on-year to Rs 2,350 crore, aided by healthy revenue growth and lower provisions.According to analysts, improved asset quality, robust growth in retail deposits and strong loan expansion were the key positives, while a miss on net interest income (NII) and fee income remains a concern.Morgan Stanley has an \u201coverweight\u201d rating on the IndusInd Bank stock with a target price of Rs 1,925.

    "IndusInd Bank on March 11 announced the launch of its contactless payments wearable \u2018Indus PayWear\u2019, touted to be India's first all-in-one tokenizable wearable for both debit and credit cards. The offering will be exclusively available for Mastercard holders now, but will soon be extended to other card networks as well, the private sector lender said.\u201cIndus PayWear is all set to revolutionize the payment experience by allowing users to effortlessly tokenize their IndusInd Bank credit or debit card onto a chip-enabled wearable device,\u201d the bank said. This, they said, will help facilitate swift and secure tap-and-pay transactions at any contactless point-of-sale (PoS) terminal across the globe, eliminating the need for carrying a physical card or using a payment app to make a purchase.The payment wearables will be available in three styles, i.e., ring, watch clasp, and stickers, and will be priced between Rs 499 and Rs 2999.The Indus PayWear mobile app will allow Indus PayWear users to opt for seamless DIY setup of the cards on the wearable. The dedicated mobile application will also allow customers to easily switch between cards. Additionally, the app provides transaction monitoring and efficient management/blocking of the wearable device for enhanced security. \u201cSecurity is paramount in the design of IndusPayWear, utilising advanced tokenization technology that replaces actual card details with unique 'tokens\u2019 to bolster the safety and security of every transaction conducted through the wearable,\u201d the bank explained.Notably, Indus PayWear transactions will offer the rewards and security of the underlying debit or credit card. While transactions below Rs 5000 will require a simple tap-and-pay function, transactions exceeding Rs 5000 will necessitate the added security of the PIN of the linked card to be entered on the PoS machine. This provision has been included as per RBI guidelines.Commenting on the product launch, Sumant Kathpalia, Managing Director & CEO, IndusInd Bank, said, \u201cAt IndusInd Bank, it has been our constant endeavour to bring forth innovative propositions that can accelerate the shift to a friction-free digital economy.

    "Surpassing the key resistance level of 22,300, which was also the previous week\u2019s high, the Nifty showed investor confidence and a bullish momentum. This upward trend resulted in a notable 0.75 percent gain on the Nifty 50 for the week, highlighting the strength of the bullish trend.Any moderate market dip should be viewed as a buying opportunity. A close below the 22,000 level in the upcoming week could signal weakening bullish sentiment, potentially prompting a retest of the 21,800 support level.The levels to watch out for in the current week would be 22,500 - 22,600 on the higher side, and 22,000 - 21,800 on the lower side.Therefore, traders are advised to monitor key support and resistance levels closely and remain flexible in their trading strategies. Being prepared to adapt to changing market conditions is crucial for navigating shifts in sentiment and seizing opportunities while managing risks effectively.Bank NiftyBank Nifty saw a substantial bounce of over 1,600 points after finding support at the 100-day exponential moving average (DEMA), coincidentally marking a 0.618 percent retracement of its previous upward movement. This rebound was notable, resulting in a weekly gain of 1.02 percent, indicating renewed buying interest at lower levels. This suggests that despite fluctuations, there remains underlying confidence and demand for banking stocks.It\u00a0is essential now to closely monitor the performance of Bank Nifty. The index must maintain support at the 46,500 level this week to sustain its bullish momentum. If it manages to hold above this level, there's potential for it to test 48,000 level, signaling further upward movement.However, failure to maintain support at 46,500 could lead to additional selling pressure, potentially pushing Bank Nifty towards the next support level at 46,000.Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:Piramal Enterprises: Buy | LTP: Rs 935 | Stop-Loss: Rs 865 | Target: Rs 1,055 | Return: 13 percentIn September 2023, PEL reached its zenith, soaring to nearly Rs 1,140. However, it subsequently endured a substantial downturn of 26 percent. Presently, the stock seems to have discovered a level of support within the bracket of Rs 840-900, suggesting a potential stabilization in its price movement.Notably, recent market observations have unveiled the formation of a double bottom pattern on the daily chart, accompanied by bullish divergence\u2014a promising indication for traders. This confluence of technical signals presents an enticing opportunity for market participants.In light of these developments, traders are advised to contemplate initiating long positions within the range of Rs 920-940. The anticipated target for this bullish trade is positioned at Rs 1,055, representing a potential upside opportunity. To manage risks effectively, it is recommended to set a stop-loss level at Rs 865, to be evaluated based on daily closing prices.Kotak Mahindra Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,724 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,665 | Target: Rs 1,820 | Return: 5.6 percentFollowing a peak close to Rs 1,926 level, Kotak Mahindra Bank underwent a substantial decline of around 10 percent in its value. However, in the past month, the bank has established a prolonged bottom around the 1.13 harmonic ratio. Interestingly, a bullish AB=CD pattern has also emerged near the aforementioned ratio, providing further bullish confirmation.Additionally, on the indicator front, there is a bullish divergence observed on the daily stochastic (please refer to the chart), indicating a positive outlook for the stock. Consequently, one may consider buying in the range of Rs 1,705-1,730 with an upside target of Rs 1,820 and a stop-loss set at Rs 1,665.IndusInd Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,526 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,475 | Target: Rs 1,600 | Return: 5 percentAfter reaching a peak near the Rs 1,695 mark, IndusInd Bank experienced a significant downturn of approximately 15.75 percent in its price. However, over the last two months, IndusInd has formed a triple bottom structure between the 100 and 200-day exponential moving averages (DEMA), presenting an enticing opportunity at its current position.Recent trading activity has seen IndusInd Bank breaking through the bear trendline while simultaneously showing bullish divergence on daily stochastics, indicating a favourable outlook for the stock.Consequently, investors may consider initiating fresh long positions within the range of Rs 1,505-1,530, with an upside target of Rs 1,600.

    "Given the decisive breakout of consolidation range with the market hitting a new historic high at the start of March F&O series, bulls took a control over bears and Dalal Street. Hence, experts expect the Nifty 50 to climb towards 22,500-22,600 zone in the coming session, with immediate support at 22,200, followed by key support at 22,000 mark.On March 1, the Nifty 50 jumped over 350 points or 1.7 percent to 22,339 and formed long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts with above average volumes, while the BSE Sensex rallied 1,245 points or 1.7 percent to 73,745.But the gains in broader markets were less compared to benchmarks. The Nifty Midcap 100 index was up 0.9 percent and Smallcap 100 index rose half a percent, while the market breadth was positive as two shares advanced for every declining share on the NSE.Stocks that recorded better performance compared to benchmarks and broader markets included Tata Steel, IndusInd Bank, and Jindal Steel & Power. Tata Steel climbed 6.5 percent to Rs 149.95, the highest closing level since August 17, 2021, and formed robust bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts with significantly higher volumes.IndusInd Bank smartly defended its 200-day EMA (exponential moving average) many a times in the recent past. The stock has seen a breakout of downward sloping resistance trendline and climbed 3.5 percent to Rs 1,526.65, forming long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily scale with above average volumes.Jindal Steel & Power has also seen a decisive breakout of falling resistance trendline and recorded 6 percent rally to end at new closing high of Rs 822.85. The stock has formed robust bullish candlestick pattern on the daily timeframe with strong volumes, while it traded above all key moving averages.Here's what Jigar S Patel of Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:Tata SteelOver last few months, Tata Steel has experienced a remarkable rally, with its stock price surging approximately 36 rupees, leading to a notable return of 31 percent within this short period. This rapid ascent has undoubtedly enhanced the appeal of the stock, drawing attention from investors enticed by its recent upward trajectory.However, despite the current attractiveness of the counter, it is imperative to exercise caution due to the significant resistance looming around the 150-155 range, primarily identified through the presence of a bearish AB=CD pattern as depicted in the chart analysis.Therefore, initiating fresh long positions at this juncture is not advisable. For individuals who have already entered the market, it is prudent to consider booking profits and adopting a wait-and-see approach, anticipating a meaningful correction in the stock's price before contemplating further investment actions.Jindal Steel & PowerIn the preceding four-month period, Jindal Steel has undergone a substantial uptick in its stock valuation, marked by an impressive surge of approximately 241 rupees. This surge, constituting a remarkable 42 percent return within this condensed timeframe, positions the company as an appealing option for investors seeking considerable profitability.The pronounced upward trajectory in the stock's performance has undeniably seized the attention of investors, enticing them with the potential for lucrative returns driven by the recent surge in momentum. However, amidst the allure of the current stock trajectory, a cautious stance is warranted.In-depth analysis of the chart data reveals a significant resistance zone spanning Rs 830-840 range, notably characterized by the presence of a bearish AB=CD pattern. This technical indication signals potential obstacles for further upward mobility in the stock price.Consequently, it is not advisable to initiate fresh long positions at this juncture. For investors who have already established positions, prudent consideration should be given to capitalizing on profits and exercising patience. One should wait for a substantial correction in the stock's price.IndusInd BankAfter reaching a peak near Rs 1,695 mark, IndusInd Bank experienced a significant downturn of almost 267 rupees, representing a substantial drop of approximately 15.75 percent in its price. However, over the last two months, the stock has formed a triple bottom structure between the 100 and 200-day exponential moving averages (DEMA), presenting an enticing opportunity at its current position.Recent trading activity has seen IndusInd breaking through the bear trendline while simultaneously showing bullish divergence on daily stochastics, indicating a favourable outlook for the stock. Consequently, investors may consider initiating fresh long positions within the range of Rs 1,505-1,530, with an upside target of Rs 1,600.

    "HDFC Bank group on February 6 received the Reserve Bank of India's approval to hike its stake up to 9.5 percent in six banks, including Yes Bank and IndusInd Bank, over the next one year.While this is sentimentally positive for the six stocks in the near term, it does\u00a0not mean that\u00a0HDFC's stake will necessarily go up to 9.5 percent in these lenders .We spoke to analysts and looked into past trends of such RBI approvals.\u00a0Here is what we found:What is the RBI approval all about?The HDFC\u00a0group as a whole, including HDFC Life, HDFC AMC and HDFC Ergo, can now acquire up to 9.5 percent stake each in\u00a0six banks -\u00a0IndusInd Bank,\u00a0Yes Bank,\u00a0Axis Bank, ICICI Bank, Suryoday Small Finance Bank and Bandhan Bank.A business group cannot hold more than 10 percent stake in a bank. Therefore, approvals are sought for 9.99 percent, the maximum limit.Despite the perceived intent, it does not mean that\u00a0full\u00a09.99 percent stake will be acquired. Since it does not make sense to seek RBI approval for every 1-2 percent stake, companies tend to ask for the maximum 9.99 percent.How much does the HDFC group currently hold in these banks?At the end of the December quarter, it held 3.43 percent in ICICI Bank, 2.57 percent in Axis Bank, 4.48 percent in IndusInd Bank and 3 percent in Yes Bank.Why is RBI approval needed?The RBI's approval is a must for anyone looking to acquire more than 5 percent stake in a bank as it is a highly regulated sector, said\u00a0Vijay Singh Gour, lead analyst, Choice Broking.Also Read:\u00a0China's market restrictions won't help, may be bad for EMs, no immediate impact on IndiaWhat is the validity of the approval?The approval is valid for a year and if HDFC fails to acquire the shareholding within that period, the approval stands cancelled.If the holding stands at\u00a0sub-5 percent before the year-end, then RBI\u2019s approval will be required again to increase it to 5 percent or more.Is this sign of merger?No. It is simply an approval for investment purpose, clarified Jignesh Shial of Incred Equities.Other examples...LIC on January 24 received the RBI's approval to acquire up to 9.99 percent in HDFC Bank. In December 2023, ICICI Prudential AMC got RBI nod to\u00a0acquire 9.99 percent in Federal Bank.In October 2023,\u00a0HDFC AMC\u00a0got the RBI\u2019s go-ahead to acquire\u00a09.5 percent in DCB Bank, Equitas Small Finance Bank, The Federal Bank, Karur Vysya Bank and City Union Bank.Also Read:\u00a0Credit growth to moderate to 13%; Paytm and lower-rated NBFCs at risk: Macquarie\u2019s Suresh GanapathyAny instances where RBI approval has lapsed\u00a0before a 9.9 percent stake acquisition?Yes.
