The 2W recovery continues to broaden, with the rural segment also making a return; we continue to expect 2-3 year growth visibility led by return of first-time buyers, with likely normal monsoons in CY24 acting as a near-term catalyst. Importantly, HMCL\u2019s positioning in the fast-growing 125cc motorcycle category has been uplifted by the recently-launched Xtreme 125R (over a month of waiting per channel checks despite strong competition; market share has improved to 17% in Apr-24 vs. the recent 9% low).

He added, \u201cYou will see some more forays into premium segment as well.\u201dHero MotoCorp had lunched the Karizma XMR (at an ex-showroom price\u00a0of\u00a0Rs 1.72 lakh), Harley Davidson X440 (Rs 2.29 lakh),and most recently Hero Mavrick 440 (Rs 1.99 lakh).\u201cOne of the segments where we can see an increase in the marketshare\u00a0by a good quantum, and I would not lay out the number, is the premium one because we have launched three big brands\u2014Harley-Davidson X440, Mavrick 440 and Karizma last year. This year,\u00a0we are going to put investments behind scaling them up and brand building,\" Gupta told analysts in a post-earnings conference call.The country\u2019s largest two-wheeler manufacturer is looking to grow its market share in the premium range of motorcycles, from around\u00a05 percent\u00a0in \u00a0the last fiscal. While it upgraded its network with the appointment of 75 Premia outlets (until March-end) and the launch of over 400 Hero 2.0 stores, it is also working on more variants of its existing premium bikes.Hero MotoCorp's Premia chain of dealerships currently houses the brand's premium motorcycles such as the Mavrick 440, X440, and the Karizma XMR, in addition to its electric scooter Vida V1.Gupta said Hero would now focus investments to\u00a0build awareness\u00a0about its premium offerings.\u00a0\"So, across the board, you can see that acceleration in the actions, very confident about our premium journey now,\u201d\u00a0he said.Gupta had earlier indicated that\u00a0the company would\u00a0ramp up its Premia outlets to 100 by June-end. In his view,\u00a0 the demand for premium motorcycles\u00a0is not only coming from metros but also from tier-II and -III areas.Replying to\u00a0a question on the response to\u00a0the higher-end motorcycles, Gupta said, \u201cWe did say that we want to increase the capacity to 10,000 per month of these three brands. In another one or two months... we will have 10,000 units per month capacity from a supply point of view.\u201dTalking specifically about the individual brands, he said, \u201cKarizma (XMR) had a good response and it is building up. Mavrick sales have just started and the Harley-Davidson X440 is actually moving up as we are expanding to more stores.\u201d The company claimed that it has established the Harley-Davidson at about 10 percent market share in areas it has been made available.Talking about other segments, Gupta revealed that after the Xoom 125, the company is gearing up to launch the Xoom 160. The new ICE scooter debuts in the first half of the financial year. \u00a0\u201cWe can confidently say that we are poised for accelerated growth moving forward for FY25 and beyond,\" Gupta said.Going forward, Gupta said that\u00a0Hero\u00a0will consistently grow volumes, thereby improving operating leverage, aggressively grow its premium portfolio, take its PAM or parts, accessories and merchandise business growth into double digits, and intensify cost saving initiatives across the value chain.\u201cWhile we do all this, we will continue to invest behind new products and segments including EVs (electric vehicles) and premium, going digital to enhance customer buying experience and new product development,\u201d he said.Early this year, Gupta indicated that\u00a0Hero will be launching three electric two-wheelers this fiscal,\u00a0including an affordable variant of the Vida electric scooter.\u00a0 As Gupta put it, \u201cWe continue to expand in our EVs, where we continue to build the infrastructure, which is 180-plus dealers, and we have expanded to 120-plus cities.\"To a question on the sales target for this year, Gupta noted, \u201cWe won\u2019t go as far as to call out the numbers on the volume guidance. We are fairly confident about our double-digit revenue growth. Now what shape and mix of volume and price and mix and all that happens, that one we will see how the industry navigates through.\u201d\n       ",
