    "The Indian economy is likely to sustain its high growth trajectory in FY2024-25, driven by strong momentum in fixed investments and a pickup in private consumption, said conglomerate ITC in its latest annual report.Besides, there are \"green shoots of recovery in rural markets\", improving employment conditions and sustained momentum in manufacturing and services sectors, which augur well for consumption demand in the near term, it added.The growth would also be supported by a good Rabi harvest and normal monsoons, according to the ITC annual report for FY 2023-24.\"India continues to be acknowledged as one of the fastest growing major economies in the world with significant headroom for growth over the medium and long-term benefiting from a slew of purposeful interventions over several years,\" it added.Factors like favourable demographic profile, increasing affluence, rapid urbanisation and accelerated digital adoption represent some of the key structural drivers of growth of the Indian economy.\"Multi-dimensional interventions undertaken by the Government of India towards the expansion of physical and digital public infrastructure, enhancing the competitiveness of the manufacturing sector, indirect/direct taxation and financial sector reforms along with measures to promote ease of doing business are expected to power the economy going forward,\" it said.Moreover, stepped-up capital expenditure outlay and focus on infrastructure are expected to drive growth in domestic manufacturing, and focus on agri-related schemes are likely to boost farmers' welfare and rural consumption demand, spurring a virtuous investment employment-consumption cycle, it added.The Kolkata-headquartered company said the agricultural sector is pivotal to the Indian economy.Steps like enhancing agricultural productivity and value addition to international standards while improving market linkages simultaneously remain critical to strengthening the competitiveness of the agri sector and increasing farmers' income.Meanwhile, the report also highlighted that the Indian economy \"contends with uncertainties\" in the external environment and policy interventions focused on supporting sustainable livelihoods and fostering inclusive growth augur well for the economy.\n       ",

Consolidated revenue grew 2% YoY (est. +4.5%). The Cigarette revenue increased 7.5% YoY, with volume growth of ~2% YoY (in line), price hikes of 3-4%, and remaining through mix improvement. The premium cigarette segment continued to outperform, while the value segment remained weak. The Paper business was hit by demand issues, competition from China,lower pulp prices, and higher input costs. Both revenue and margin were weak; however, a gradual recovery is likely in FY25.

    "Minority shareholders are expected to benefit from the demerger of ITC's hotel business into a separate entity, ITC Hotels, as it may unlock value for them, and improve return ratios of the FMCG major, as per reports of four proxy advisory firms.The reports from proxy advisory firms, including InGovern Research Services, ISS and SES, come ahead of the June 6 meeting of shareholders of ITC to consider and approve the demerger proposal.According to proxy advisory firm ISS, the demerger may unlock value for its shareholders and improve ITC's return ratios.\"The structure will enable ITC Hotels to operate with an optimal capital structure with the ability to access capital to fund its growth requirements.\"It can attract the right set of investors, strategic partners and collaborations whose investment strategies are more sharply aligned with that of the hospitality industry,\" ISS said in its report.Last year in August, ITC board had approved the demerger of its hotels business into a separate entity. Shareholders of ITC will get one share in the soon-to-be-listed hotel entity for every 10 shares they hold in the company.Highlighting the benefit of demerger, another advisory firm InGovern said that the current ITC shareholders will receive a direct stake in a dedicated, publicly traded hotel entity, becoming shareholders of a specialised company focused solely on the hotel business.This move aligns with ITC's corporate strategy of fostering multiple growth drivers, ensuring continued interest in the hotel sector, and protecting against potential hostile takeovers in the future, it said.\"Given the clean swap of shares which is beneficial for the minority shareholders as well as for the growth of both the companies, we recommend shareholders vote for this scheme of arrangement,\" it said.Proxy advisory firm SES is of the view that the decision to keep 40 per cent stake with ITC, is a strategic decision to give stability and allow fair discovery of price and is in interest of shareholders. SES does not identify any major concern with regard to the proposed demerger.Another proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis, has also recommended the proposed demerger scheme.However, Institutional Investor Advisory Services (IiAS) has suggested shareholders of ITC Ltd to vote against the proposed demerger of the hotel business on the grounds that it does not provide complete value unlocking for shareholders.\n       ",

It remains uncertain whether they plan to sell this equity to a strategic buyer or keep it. IiAS is asking the management for more details on this issue.\"While [the demerger] partially unlocks value, capital support will likely continue to be provided by ITC to the hotels business in its capacity as a Promoter,\" IiAS addedSES sees no concern regarding the valuations of ITC Hotels. It said,\u00a0\u201cSince ITC Hotels will have mirror shareholding (60 percent of ITC) and balance will remain with ITC, the valuation is immaterial at this stage. Further, as ITC Hotels will be listed value will be through a transparent price discovery mechanism. Hence, no concern is identified in this regard.\u201dThe hotel segment is the smallest in ITC's portfolio, contributing only 3 to 5 percent to its overall revenue.

    "During the week ended April 26, the market, particularly the Nifty 50, showed rangebound behaviour despite an initial gap-up opening on Monday. Throughout the week, it struggled to break free from this consolidation pattern, eventually closing with modest gains of approximately 1.23 percent. Despite attempts to breach the resistance at 22,600, the Nifty failed to sustain above it, and a sharp downturn in the final session led to the erosion of most of its gains.From a technical standpoint, the Nifty is trading within a rising channel pattern, suggesting potential bullish momentum if it manages to maintain levels above 22,300 in the current week, with a likely target range of 22,750-22,800.Additionally, the long-short ratio of foreign institutional investors (FIIs) stands at 39 percent, indicating limited downside potential.Looking forward, immediate resistance levels for the Nifty are projected at 22,700-22,800, and a decisive close above this range could trigger renewed buying interest in the index futures. Conversely, a breach of the support at 22,300 might intensify the selling pressure in the markets.As for the Nifty Bank index, it experienced a notable uptrend, rallying approximately 2,000 points from the low of 46,600 levels and ending the week with gains of about 1.32 percent. However, the breakout from the cup-and-handle pattern faced significant resistance in the 48,600-48,700 zone, notably near the previous top recorded on December 28, 2023 at 48,636.Surpassing the 49,000 level appears challenging for the Nifty Bank, with support seen at 47,700; a breach of this level could potentially trigger further selling in the index.Here are three buy calls for the next 2-3 weeks:Navin Fluorine International: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,310 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,095 | Target: Rs 3,700 | Return: 12 percentFollowing its Double Top formation near the Rs 4,900-4,800 zone, Navin Fluorine has experienced a significant downturn, shedding 41 percent in price. However, in the last 5-6 trading sessions, it has found support near Rs 3,000 mark.Concurrently, a Bullish Crab pattern has materialized on Navin Fluorine's daily chart, signaling a potential reversal in trend. Moreover, \"regular bull divergence\"* has been identified on the relative strength index (RSI) daily scale, indicating strengthening bullish momentum.Based on these technical indicators, investors may consider initiating long positions within the range of Rs 3,270-3,320. The upside target for this trade is set at Rs 3,700. To manage risk, a stop-loss order should be placed near Rs 3,095, helping to limit potential losses in case the trade doesn't perform as expected.NOTE: If the price is making lower lows, but the oscillator is making higher lows, this is considered to be regular bullish divergence.ITC: Buy | LTP: Rs 440 | Stop-Loss: Rs 412 | Target: Rs 480 | Return: 9 percentAfter reaching a peak near Rs 475 mark on January 4, 2024, ITC has experienced a significant decline of approximately 16 percent. However, in the subsequent 18 trading sessions, ITC has shown stability by avoiding further declines and has instead consolidated within a range of Rs 400-416.Notably, in the previous trading session, there was notable buying interest observed at lower levels, accompanied by substantial trading volume. From a technical standpoint, the formation of a bullish AB=CD pattern on the daily chart of ITC within the mentioned price zone of Rs 400-416. Interestingly, this zone also coincides with the 0.382 percent retracement level of a price swing that occurred between January 2023 and July 2023, as indicated on the chart.Additionally, RSI weekly has reversed from 45 levels, which suggests a potentially lucrative buying opportunity.Thus, one can buy in the zone of Rs 430-440, with an upside target of Rs 480 and a stop-loss would be placed near Rs 412 on a daily close basis.Piramal Enterprises: Buy | LTP: Rs 926 | Stop-Loss: Rs 845 | Target: Rs 1,055 | Return: 14 percentIn September 2023, PEL reached its zenith, soaring to nearly Rs 1,140. However, it subsequently endured a substantial downturn, plummeting by 29 percent. Presently, the stock seems to have discovered a level of support within the bracket of Rs 820-850, suggesting a potential stabilization in its price movement.Notably, recent market observations have unveiled the formation of a Double Bottom pattern on the daily chart, accompanied by bear-trendline violation on weekly RSI \u2014a promising indication for traders. This confluence of technical signals presents an enticing opportunity for market participants.In light of these developments, traders are advised to contemplate initiating long positions within the range of Rs 900-930. The anticipated target for this bullish trade is positioned at Rs 1,055, representing a potential upside opportunity.To manage risks effectively, it is recommended to set a stop-loss level at Rs 845, to be evaluated based on daily closing prices.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

HUL in its recent earnings urged investor patience amid continued sluggish volume growth in the FMCG sector.

    "India's diversified entity ITC plans to open more hotels overseas with neighbouring countries and the Middle East as primary target markets after opening of its first international property here, company Chairman and Managing Director Sanjiv Puri said on Thursday.The company's arm ITC Hotels, which had opened 22 new properties in the last 24 months, plans to add another 70 hotels in the next five years in India as part of expansion plans in the hospitality sector. Besides the hotels business, the company will look for opportunities to expand the presence of FMCG and other verticals in new overseas markets as well.\"We are open to exploring opportunities that come about. I think we have strong credentials in hospitality which we can take outside India now. Very clearly at the moment the focus is on proximal markets, be it for hospitality, be it for FMCG\u2026,\" Puri said here at a press conference after the opening of the 352-room luxury property, ITC Ratnadipa here. He said as the company explores and understands a place for a particular business, it may look at it as a market for other verticals as well.Citing the example of Nepal, Puri said,\"We started with other businesses and are now looking at hospitality (there). Here (in Sri Lanka) we have started with hospitality\u2026as we explore and understand the place, we will look at possibilities in some of our other sectors as well.\" On overseas expansion of the hospitality business, while the company's focus is more on 'proximal markets', he said,\"We are open to it if there are some interesting opportunities beyond it. We will certainly be interested in pursuing that.\"When asked if ITC is looking at the Middle East as a market for the hospitality business, he said it is a vibrant economy right now with terrific growth plans and \"if opportunity comes our way then we will certainly explore that\". Puri also said the company will look to expand in more destinations in Sri Lanka going forward.\"This (opening of ITC Ratnadipa) is the starting point and yes, we want to expand and grow the economy and contribute to the development of tourism in Sri Lanka,\" he said. When asked about ITC's overall expansion plans in the hospitality sector, he said,\"We have a very healthy pipeline of 70 hotels in five years.\"All these 70 hotels are for the Indian domestic market and most of them will be the upscale segments. He, however, said \"(For) overseas we're just starting our journey. So we have not yet got to the stage to start putting a number right here.\"On investments planned for the overall expansion, he did not share a specific number but said \"between renovation and new properties will spend somewhere between Rs 700 crore to Rs 1,000 crore a year\". When asked about the progress of the demerger of ITC Hotels and its planned public listing, Puri said it is happening in line with the indicated timelines and is expected \"before the second half of this year or the end of this year\".At its new property here, the company had invested about USD 500 million. It was inaugurated on Thursday by Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe. The ITC Ratnadipa or 'Island of Gems' has 352 guest rooms, suites and service apartments, each with private balconies with waterfront views.Earlier in the day, speaking at the opening of the new hotel, Puri said,\"It is very natural for us to specifically focus on markets in proximal areas, encouraged also by our Prime Minister's (Narendra Modi) vision of neighbourhood first where Sri Lanka has a very special position. ITC is deeply committed to growing our presence and contributing to hospitality in the region.\"\n       ",
