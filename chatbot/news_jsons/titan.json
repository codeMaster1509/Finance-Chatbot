    "Leisure, jewellery, out-of-home food and healthcare businesses, and particularly the premium brands from these businesses will benefit from the rising population of 'affluent' Indians, according to Goldman Sachs.A report titled 'The Rise of Affluent India', authored by analysts in Goldman Sachs' Global Investment Research division said that several data points, including bank deposits, tax filings and credit card usage point to a fast-growing demographic of affluent Indians. The analysts defined affluent Indians as those earning an annual income of more than $10,000.Also read:\u00a0'Affluent India' growing at 12% vs total population's 1%, divergence seen in stock performance: Goldman SachsSeveral stocks could benefit from the trend, but the analysts have picked out eight names within their coverage based on two factors. These eight stocks also have, according to the analysts, \"high-quality businesses with strong competitive advantages, proven track records of past performance and market leadership within their segments\".1. TitanTitan has a 7-8\u00a0percent market share in jewellery (FY22), which is largely the upper-income end of jewellery consumption given the higher mix of diamond jewellery and complex gold jewellery compared to other large organised jewellers and mom-and-pop stores. The brand is priced at a premium to most other jewellers in the market due to its aspirational brand, range of offerings and transparent policies around the exchange of old jewellery. As the analysts expect the cohort of \u2018Affluent India\u2019 consumers to grow by 12 percent CAGR, they also expect Titan to have a tailwind of increasing consumer footfall and rising market share. The brand is gaining market share by entering new cities, increasing its presence in wedding jewellery with more regional customisation, and international business expansion. Store expansion will be a key growth driver for Tanishq.2. Apollo HospitalsWith the disease burden in the country shifting towards 'Lifestyle' versus communicable, Apollo\u2019s ARPOB (Average revenue per occupied bed) is industry-leading in a combination of performing the largest number of tertiary/quaternary care procedures thanks to its brand capital and medical expertise from 13,200 practising doctors (both employed and service fee based). Also, the hospitals have been delivering clinical outcomes that are best in class, which are metrics that Affluent Indians will pay close attention to. As of FY23, 84 percent of Apollo Hospitals'payor mix comprised two segments of households \u2014 housesholds with higher per capital income and with a propensity to pay for high-end tertiary/quaternary care either out of pocket or houses that are sufficiently covered by health insurance \u2014 and the analysts expect the hospital brand to remain dominant going forward with further shifts towards insurance as awareness increases.According to them, growth in health insurance has been one of the drivers of higher ARPOB.3. Phoenix Millshe analysts believe Phoenix\u2019s mall portfolio is poised for 25 percent EBITDA growth CAGR (FY23-FY27), driven by the rising cohort of \u2018Affluent India\u2019; in-mall tenant premiumisation and densification; and new mall additions. Beyond FY27, they expect its mall portfolio to deliver 10-12 percent annual organic consumption growth, in line with consumer discretionary growth. Also, they noted, that mature malls for Phoenix generate a post-tax ROCE of 15\u00a0percent, which provides cash flows to reinvest in the construction of new malls (with JV partners), without taking up leverage.The report stated that 90 percent of consumption in Phoenix malls is in discretionary categories (see below, data as of H1FY24), which cater to the 'Affluent India' cohort.Also, with Phoenix having established a track record amongst retailers, the analysts see lower earnings risk for Phoenix, compared to other malls, as typically any new mall announcement in a new city leads to at least 70 percent of the space being pre-leased with those retailers (based on historical trends).4. Makemytrip (MMYT)The Indian travel industry is expected to grow at 13 percent FY24E-27E CAGR (in line with growth in Affluent India), with online growth expected to grow faster at 15 percent CAGR over the same period. Within travel, the analysts expect relatively premium categories such as international travel and mid/high-end hotels to be the fastest growing segments (greater than 20 percent growth), driven by both a shift to online and rising income levels. MMYT is India\u2019s largest online travel platform, with around 50 percent market share; and the analysts forecast 20 percent/34 percent FY24E-27E revenue/EBITDA CAGR, and view MMYT as a key beneficiary of double-digit growth in India\u2019s \u2018affluent\u2019 income cohort, the core user base of the company. Also, the brand has exposure to under-penetrated segments of hotels and international travel, which will help the brand grow faster than the market; and the analysts don't see the competition dynamics in the Indian market changing much. With 5x the scale of its nearest competitor and a strong balance sheet, the analysts see limited risks to the company's market share.The analysts forecast revenue growth for MMYT to be the highest among global peers.5. ZomatoThe analysts estimate the number of transacting users in India\u2019s online grocery and food delivery industry (of 25-30 million monthly transacting users or MTUs) is a subset of the \u2018Affluent India\u2019 cohort, and expect growth in these segments to be indexed to the 13 percent population growth of this cohort. This is expected to be further aided by AOV (average order value) and frequency growth and shift to online, resulting in around 20-35 percent GOV (gross order value) CAGR across food delivery/online grocery industries over FY24E-27E. They forecast 22-45 percent FY24E-27E GOV (gross order value) CAGR for Zomato\u2019s food delivery/online grocery, with MTUs being the biggest growth driver.The analysts expect India\u2019s food delivery and online grocery MTU base to track growth in income levels...6&7.\u00a0Devyani and Sapphire (Yum Indian franchisees)These are Yum India franchisees and the analysts are optimistic about KFC's growth prospects in India.Quick service restaurants (QSRs) have been the fastest growing restaurant format in India with around 25 percent CAGR over FY10-20, the analysts noted and added that the QSR demand has come largely from the Affluent India cohort. The customer base of QSR in India at around 30 mn is a subset of their estimate of around 60 million \u2018Affluent Indians\u2019. Among QSR formats, the analysts preferred KFC in India because of its under-penetration \u2014 only 1,000 KFC outlets vs 3,000 pizza QSR outlets. The reason for this was the unattractive unit economics before FY19, which has since then been improved with initiatives such as lowering store sizes and higher share of delivery through food aggregators. The brand is also the dominant fried chicken player in the country.Goldman Sachs' research team expects a cyclical recovery in KFC's average daily sales (ADS) per store, starting FY25.Also read:\u00a0Goldman Sachs predicts govt capex growth to decline to 10% in FY25, down from 30% in last 3 years8. Eicher MotorsThe brand is usually the second or third motorcycle in the customers' ownership journey, representing aspirational positioning. Royal Enfield's average selling price (ASP) is 3x the ASP of the average motorcycle. Also, the larger trend in the market is favourable for the brand. The analysts pointed to the 350cc+ market consistently outgrowing the 2W market \u2014 11 percent CAGR vs flat growth of the broader 2W market over FY15 to FY23; and +15 percent vs +7 percent of the broader market in FY24. Therefore, the points in its favour are the company\u2019s exposure to the premiumisation trend in automotive buying, lower near-term risk from electrification in premium motorcycling, strong pipeline of upcoming product launches (Shotgun 650 unveiled, 10 new models/refreshes expected over the next 3 years); ability to withstand multiple competitive threats even from Harley Davidson and Triumph, upside optionality from higher contribution by more profitable accessories/merchandising business.

    "India witnessed a remarkable 21 percent year-on-year (YoY) growth in smartwatch shipments during the third quarter of 2023 (July-September), according to the latest research from Counterpoint's IoT Service.

While existing top players continued to drive the market, new players like Fastrack and beatXP shipped high volumes and chipped away market share from the top three.\u201cIn the coming years, the market will continue to grow in double digits due to the brands\u2019 efforts to expand their portfolios, offline partnerships with several large-format retailers (LFRs) and growing emphasis on local manufacturing,\u201d said Anshika Jain, senior research analyst.Fire-Boltt emerged as the market leader, capturing an impressive 28 percent share, closely trailed by Noise and boAt. Notably, Fastrack, a sub-brand of Titan, achieved the highest annual growth among the top five brands, showcasing its increasing prominence in the sector. Additionally, beatXP made its debut in the top five, marking a notable entry into the competitive smartwatch market.Commenting on the price analysts noted the emphasis on budget-friendly options has led to a significant 41 percent YoY decline in India's smartwatch average selling price (ASP), reaching its all-time low. Consequently, more than three-fifths of the market now falls within the less than Rs 2,000 price range.\u201cThis quarter, smartwatches were even available for less than\u00a0Rs 1,000 to target first-time users. The shorter replacement cycles for the basic smartwatches and the maximum number of new launches being in this price segment further accelerated the trend,\u201d said Harshit Rastogi, Research Analyst.\n       ",
    "Titan Company crossed the Rs 3 lakh crore market share on November 21. The stock has seen a strong momentum through this year, gaining 34 percent and about 6 percent in November alone. It hit a fresh 52-week high of Rs 3,441.45 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) on November 23. Can this momentum continue?Most analysts are bullish on Titan, what with its impressive growth in the jewellery business and its premium position in the sector. There are, however, some cautious voices. They point out that low diamond prices might put pressure on profitability.In its Q2FY24 results, the company\u2019s consolidated net profit rose 9.7 percent on-year to Rs 916 crore, while consolidated revenue jumped 36 percent to Rs 12,529 crore. The jewellery business grew, driven by India operations, and domestic sales were aided by a double-digit growth of buyers and average bill value per buyer.Follow our market blog to catch all the live actionOutlookAnalysts believe that Titan's core domestic business has a long runway for growth. Going ahead, market expansion, buoyant gold prices, and robust demand during the wedding season, will boost profitability.Titan has taken some price correction in solitaires and this impact should be evident in the coming 7-8 months, said Jefferies in a report.According to the international brokerage, Titan is a structural growth story. Buoyant gold prices, share gains, higher wedding budgets for jewellery, and cost focus are among the key catalysts for the stock. However, concerns remain over steep valuations.Margins to improveIn the quarter gone by, the benefits of low-cost inventory faded out completely and plain gold jewellery sales increased. This impacted margins. The management has allayed investor concerns on the margin impact from the recent correction in diamond prices.\"The impact would be limited to the solitaire portfolio, which has a low salience in Titan's studded business. The management, in its guidance, reiterated that it is aiming for 12-13 percent margins on an annual basis,\u201d Jefferies added.According to Dolal Capital, an increase in studded jewellery contribution would help improve EBITDA margin. Going ahead, the company expects 12-13 percent steady-state margins in the jewellery business (ex-bullion sales). Aggressive pricing by the company is expected to ease, leading to improved margins in the future, according to B&K Securities analysts.Also Read |\u00a0Titan stock extends gains on CCI nod to acquire additional stake in CaratLaneMarket expansionThe company continues to expand its jewellery store reach.

But, analysts are not too worried, it seems. The company is now expanding its market share by\u00a0targeting the low-market share and luxury high-value space in domestic markets as well as overseas, which is the next growth trigger, they feel.Luxury stocks are fancied globally right now with the rich continuing to be on a spending spree post-pandemic; so as long as the company can extract a fair share of this unfair spending, the stock will offer an unfair advantage.Godrej PropertiesWith Friday's rally, the technical reasons are supportive, but fundamentally, Godrej Properties is among the most expensive bets in the listed real estate space.

It has downgraded the stock from a 'buy' and lowered the target price from Rs 4,280 to Rs 3,750\u00a0on growing uncertainties about its long-term product strategy and concerns about the company's ability to win technology-based energy orders due to competitive dynamics.Investors may also grapple with the market valuation of its energy business. Siemens Energy is now looking to sell its 24 percent stake in Siemens India to Siemens AG.

    "Avnish Anand, the co-founder of CaratLane has been appointed as the startup\u2019s new chief executive officer (CEO) with immediate effect. The decision comes just days after his co-founder and former boss, Mithun Sacheti, made a remarkable exit by selling his CaratLane shares to Titan.Last week, Titan, which already holds 71.09 percent in CaratLane, said it would further increase its stake to 98.28 percent by buying out Sacheti\u2019s 27.18 percent share in the online jewellery retailer for Rs 4,621 crore. The deal valued CaratLane at Rs 17,000 crore. It also marked the second biggest e-commerce exit in India, just after Walmart\u2019s $16 billion deal for Flipkart which gave both founders, Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal, over $1 billion each.About a week after Sacheti\u2019s exit, Anand has now been promoted from his previous role as the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of CaratLane.\u201cAvnish (Anand)... was employee No.1 at CaratLane and an integral part of the founding team.
