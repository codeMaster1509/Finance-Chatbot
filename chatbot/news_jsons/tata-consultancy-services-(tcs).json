Apart from domestic factors, global cues like performance of the US markets, crude movement etc will remain on the radar,\u201d said Ajit Mishra, VP \u2013 Research, Religare Broking Ltd.India\u2019s largest IT services firm Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on Friday reported a 5.2 per cent year-on-year rise in consolidated net profit to Rs 9,478 crore for the first quarter ended June 30.It reported a 16.2 per cent growth in revenue at Rs 52,758 crore for the quarter, with all the big geographies and business segments reporting strong numbers, but it was operating profit margins, which slid down to 23.1 per cent \u2014 much lower than the aspirational band of over 26 per cent \u2014 that hurt the profit growth.Brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher said the company has missed on both revenue and margins in the June quarter results.On the earnings front, ACC, HCL Technologies, Jindal Steel and Power, MindTree, Federal Bank and HDFC Bank will announce their Q1 numbers during the week.\u201c\u2026 IIP and CPI numbers will be announced on 12th July whereas WPI will be announced on 14th July.

    "The first earnings season for the financial year 2023 will kick start tomorrow and as has become customary over the past few quarters, India\u2019s largest IT services provider\u00a0Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) will open the innings this time too.Experts look forward to a healthy on-year revenue growth for the Indian IT services sector that was aided by a secular demand environment, healthy deal wins, and mergers and acquisitions. They expect a steady sequential USD-reported revenue growth but it may be affected by adverse cross-currency and seasonality for a few companies in the sector.For the bellwether of Indian IT services sector, TCS, the expectation is that the company will report a consolidated revenue growth of 15-16 percent on-year and 4-5 percent on-quarter for the first quarter ended June 2022. The company is expected to log in consolidated revenues of Rs 55,600 crore for the quarter.The consolidated profit after tax (PAT) for the largest Indian IT services company, is expected to rise by 10 percent on-year but is likely to remain flat on a sequential basis. TCS is expected to post a bottomline of Rs 9,800 crore.The company had recorded a consolidated net profit of Rs 9,008 crore during the corresponding period of last financial year when its consolidated revenues stood at Rs 45,411 crore. TCS had registered a PAT of Rs 9,926 crore during January to March 2022 period on revenues of Rs 50,591 crore.USD and constant currency revenuesExperts expect the dollar revenues for the company to grow by close to 11 percent on year and ~2 percent sequentially while constant currency (CC) revenues are expected to grow by 3.5 percent sequentially.\u201cWe expect CC revenue growth of 3.7 percent QoQ (2.3 percent QoQ in USD) on strong momentum in digital transformation programs while we expect growth to be broad based across verticals\u201d, a report from the brokerage firm Phillip Capital said.A report from Emkay Research expect 2.1 percent sequential revenue growth in US dollar terms as its factors in 190\u00a0basis points cross-currency headwinds.Service line revenue mix between change the business and run the business is likely to remain similar to global tech spending. \u201cTCS has diversified its presence across verticals, geographies and service lines and is likely to be beneficiary of large cost-takeout deals and vendor consolidation deals,\u201d a report from ICICI Securities said.MarginsAn uptick in wages and travel and visa costs is likely to impact the margins during the quarter both on a yearly and sequential basis.The EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) margin\u00a0is likely to dip 190 bps on-year and 140 bps on-quarter to 26 percent.\u201cMargins are expected to decline by 140 bps sequentially due to wage hikes, travel costs while supply side pressures are likely to be offset by the currency depreciation,\u201d a report from Phillip Capital said.The brokerage expects the EBIT margin to trip to 23.6 percent for the reported quarter compared to 25.5 percent during the same quarter a year ago and 25 percent in the quarter ended March 2022.ICICI Securities has worked out an EBIT margin of 23.5 percent, while Motilal Oswal Financial Services forecasts it at 23.9 percent.Key things to watch out forThe experts will be closely watching the management\u2019s comments on the demand trends in key verticals like BFSI, Retail, Manufacturing and Communications along with the deal intake/pipeline in Q1. Another key parameter to watch out for will be the price environment considering high inflation and tight labor markets as well as margin outlook, supply side challenges and attrition.Experts at Emkay Research will also be looking for updates on regional markets outlook, any impact on tech spending from higher energy prices, inflation and potential economic slowdown/recession and if there are any delay/deferral/cancellation of projects due to macro uncertainties, high inflation and supply chain disruptions.However, according to Motilal Oswal Financial Services, TCS remains best positioned to benefit from the long-term structural tailwinds in Tech Services and should see a relative pickup in growth as the base effect and increased aggression aid it.TCS\u00a0shares traded flat ahead of earnings on\u00a0\u00a0Friday. It was up 0.29 per cent on BSE.Disclaimer:\u00a0The views and investment tips of investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India's largest IT services company had come out with its fourth\u00a0buyback offer (till date) on March 9 and the offer\u00a0 drew to a close today (March 23).As per the latest regulatory data available on the BSE website (updated till 4.00 pm on March 23), at the closure of the offer, shareholders had tendered a total of\u00a0301 million shares through this buyback.Through this offer, TCS intended to buy back 40 million shares, or close to 1.1 percent, of its equity at a price of Rs 4,500 per share which is at a premium of over 21 percent to the closing price of Rs 3,708.25 (BSE) on March 23.The Rs 18,000-crore buyback by TCS which is by far the biggest offer by an IT company in India, generated strong interest from shareholders as is evident from over\u00a07.5 times over-subscription to the issue size.As per the details shared initially for the buyback entitlement, TCS had said that in the reserved category for small shareholders, the ratio of buyback will be \"1 equity share for every 7 equity shares held on the record date\" while in the general category for all other eligible shareholders, the ratio of buyback will be \"1 equity share for every 108 equity shares held on the record date\".Notably, this is\u00a0TCS'\u00a0fourth buyback and, in the earlier three buybacks, Tata Sons was the biggest beneficiary. Experts tracking the company said citing precedence, that Tata Sons, the promoter of the company stands to gain the most from the buyback if it has participated in the offer.In 2020,\u00a0TCS bought back more than 53 million shares at Rs 3,000 a share and 33.33 million shares were accepted under the offer including Tata Sons\u2019 33,325,118 equity shared. In 2017 and 2018 as well, it undertook two buybacks\u00a0and the size was around Rs 16,000 crore each. At the end of September 2021, TCS had cash and cash equivalents of Rs 51,950 crore on its balance sheet.The latest move comes after Tata Sons bought Air India from the government for Rs 18,000 crore. The firm will pay Rs 2,700 crore to the government and the rest will go to paying debt. Tata Sons holds a 72\u00a0percent stake in TCS currently.Experts are of the opinion that share buyback by the corporates has become the most tax-efficient way of returning money to shareholders since the government has started taxing dividends in the hands of the receivers. As per the applicable tax rates, the effective tax on dividend now comes to 30 per cent for large shareholders since it becomes part of their income. Compared to this, a company pays only 20 per cent tax on share buyback depending the difference between the market price and the issue price.Analysts say share buybacks also typically improve earnings per share and return surplus cash to shareholders while also supporting the stock during sluggish market conditions.In September 2021, Infosys announced a buyback of Rs 9,200 crore while in January 2021 Wipro conducted a Rs 9,500 crore buyback. In 2018, HCL Tech had undertaken a Rs 4000 crore buyback.The premium of the offer price compared to the current market price was not so much when the buy-back was announced. Experts say that the premium became much more pronounced due to the recent correction in the market. Investors tend to take advantage of this arbitrage by buying shares from the markets and tendering them in the buyback offer.\n       ",

The outlook is stable.\"The upgrade reflects Fitch's reassessment of the linkages between TCS and Tata Sons Private Limited (TSOL), which holds 72% of TCS, based on Fitch's updated Parent and Subsidiary Linkage (PSL) Rating Criteria,\" the rating agency said in its release.The agency further added that it now rates TCS at the same level as its Standalone Credit Profile (SCP) of 'a' as set out in the criteria for a stronger investee of an investment holding company (IHC) such as TSOL, where it believes that the IHC will not weaken the credit quality of the investee by taking out cash or other assets.TCS shares, meanwhile, were trading over 1 percent lower at Rs\u00a03,576.35 apiece on the BSE, at the time of writing this report.Fitch's key assumptions within its rating case for TCS are as below -- Revenue to grow by 11%-15% annually in FY22 and FY23- Operating EBITDA margin of 26%-27% (FY21: 27%)- Capex/sales ratio at around 2% (FY21: 2%)- Distribution of most of the pre-dividend free cash flow (FCF) via cash dividends and share buybacks.\n       ",
