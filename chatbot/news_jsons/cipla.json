(rDNA Origin) injection] and Trulicity (Dulaglutide) from 2021.As a part of this agreement, Lilly had transfered its rights in India to sell, promote and distribute the two Lilly Diabetes products to Cipla.In February, Eli Lilly CEO David Ricks said that the company expects to launch Mounjaro, its blockbuster diabetes drug and wildly popular obesity treatment, in India as early as next year (2025) after it clears an ongoing regulatory review.Mounjaro (tirzepatide) injection, is a prescription medicine for adults with type 2 diabetes used along with diet and exercise to improve blood sugar (glucose).The management expects EBITDA margins to come at 25 percent for FY 25. EBITDA for FY24 came in at Rs 6233 crore and 24.5 percent EBITDA margin in the period.The company is also closer to the remediation of its plant in Indore for the US FDA inspection.

    "Pharmaceutical major Cipla Ltd is expected to report a healthy Q4 results, with revenue boosted by steady US sales, and profit growing over the previous year\u2019s low base. The drugmaker is due to report its fiscal fourth quarter results on May 10.According to a poll of eight brokerages collated by Moneycontrol, Cipla\u2019s Q4 FY24 net profit is likely to grow around 65 percent on-year to Rs 891 crore. In the previous year (base period) Cipla's net profit was impacted by one-time impairment charges worth Rs 182.42 crore due to an acquisition in Uganda and its assets in Yemen. Adjusted for the same, Cipla's bottomline is likely to grow 28 percent on-year. CIPLA Q4 FY24 PREVIEWRevenue is expected to grow 8.4 percent year-on-year to Rs 6,224 crore for the January-March quarter.The drugmaker's operating margins are also expected to remain steady and meet the management's guidance of 24 percent, both for Q4 and full FY24.Among the brokerages polled by Moneycontrol, Kotak Institutional Equities issued the most bullish estimates for Cipla while Prabhudas Lilladher estimated the lowest growth.Steady US salesThe company's US business is expected to aid its growth in Q4. The surge in US sales will be driven by the contribution from blockbuster cancer drug Revlimid, along with a stable market share in Albuterol (respiratory drug) and an expansion in Lanreotide (hormonal drug) and Brovana (inhalation drug). Axis Securities expects Cipla's base sales in the US business to come around $225 million (Rs 1,880 crore), primarily driven by these drugs.Brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities estimates Revlimid's contribution for Cipla to rise marginally to $28 million from $25 million in the previous quarter.Also Read |\u00a0Cipla, Glenmark recall drugs from US market: USFDAOther marketsMeanwhile, the company's domestic business growth would likely be limited to high-single-digit or even low-double-digit due to weak seasonality. Nomura believes the drugmaker's acquisitions in the domestic market will aid its on-year growth in Q4.Meanwhile, the brokerage also estimated 3 percent year-on-year South Africa sales growth in constant currency terms, aided by the acquisition of Actor Pharma, to some extent. However, revenue growth from the segment in rupee terms will be lower due to the depreciation of South African Rand against the Indian rupee in the past year.That aside, investors will watch management's outlook for new drug launches, especially since two of the drugmaker's major launches -- respiratory drug Advair and chemotherapy drug Abraxane -- are delayed due to regulatory headwinds.On May 9 at 12:15 pm, Cipla's shares on BSE were trading 0.7 percent lower at Rs 1,375 apiece. The stock has gained nearly 10 percent since January this year, and about 47 percent in the last one year, outperforming benchmark Nifty index.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "By Jigar S Patel, senior manager - equity research at Anand RathiThe market dynamics in April were characterized by volatility, with both global and domestic factors influencing sentiment. Globally, geopolitical tensions and a downturn in US markets affected markets, while domestically, corrections in IT\u00a0stocks and\u00a0newsflow\u00a0relating to banking added to the pressure. Despite reaching a peak of 22,794 on April 2, the Nifty 50 index faced hurdles around the 22,800 mark, failing to surpass it despite repeated attempts.The index displayed a bearish pattern after a heavy selloff from its all-time high on May 3, with technical analysis indicating it's trading within a rising channel, now aiming towards 22,900 \u2013 22,950. However, the supply is expected in this zone, and the volatility index (VIX) bouncing back suggests challenges ahead. On the downside, a breach below 22,300 could lead to a slide towards 22,100 \u2013 22,000.In the banking sector, while heavy supply impacted Kotak Mahindra Bank, stocks like ICICI Bank drove the Nifty Bank to new highs, surpassing 48,636 and aiming towards the milestone of 50,000. However, this level presents a significant hurdle, coinciding with resistance from a rising channel.Hurdles at 49,600\u00a0/ 50,000\u00a0/ 50,600 are expected, while breaching 48,500 could lead to further downside pressure on Nifty Bank.

    "The benchmark Nifty ended just above 22,500, marking a flat weekly close, on April 12. While the weekly chart shows little change, reverting to the previous week's close, the daily chart reveals a notable hesitancy at higher levels.Prices have precisely retreated from the upper boundary of the 'rising channel' pattern, a formation we highlighted earlier during the week. Accompanied by a ' two-point negative divergence' on the RSI-smoothened indicator, a cautious approach is advisable for bulls camp at higher levels.Traders should refrain from chasing buying opportunities at elevated levels and are encouraged to consider profit-booking on any bounce back. Notably, the range of 22,700 to 22,800 presents significant resistance.Conversely, key indices hover slightly above their previous swing high, technically considered as a support level. For the Nifty, this lies within the range of 22,450 to 22,500, and a breach may trigger further profit-booking, potentially towards 22,300 and beyond in the near term. Traders should monitor these levels closely and adjust their trading strategies accordingly.Further, Friday's market weakness was largely attributed to geopolitical concerns, underscoring the importance of closely monitoring these developments as they could impact market dynamics.Here is one buy call and one sell idea for short term:CDSL: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,008 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,909 | Target: Rs 2,185 | Return: 9 percentA few months back, the Central Depository Services (CDSL) prices witnessed a long-term bullish breakout, yet in recent weeks, it has been trading within a certain range. However, it's now showing signs of resuming its upward trend, as evidenced by closing above the recent congestion zone, affirming a breakout in the continuation channel pattern.Notably, there has been an increase in trading volumes during the period of up-move as compared to the volume of period during consolidation, suggesting strong accumulation.Even amid a weaker overall market, this particular stock showed strength on Friday. With prices comfortably above the key averages and oscillators indicating positive positions, the outlook for buying remains supported. Hence, we recommend buying CDSL around Rs 2,008 - 2,000, with a stop-loss of Rs 1,909 and target of Rs 2,185.Cipla: Sell | LTP: Rs 1,397 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,440 | Target: Rs 1,320 | Return: 5.5 percentIn recent weeks, on the daily chart, stock prices have been moving within a defined range. However, by recently breaking below the lower boundary of this range, a distribution pattern breakdown known as a 'Double Top' has been confirmed. This pattern finds support in a negative divergence observed in the momentum indicator RSI (relative strength index), where prices reached new highs but the oscillator did not.The current downturn is further supported by increased trading volume, and prices have fallen below both the 20 and 50 EMA (exponential moving average), indicating a shift in momentum favoring the bears.Given these observations, we anticipate further weakness in this stock. Hence, we recommend selling Cipla around Rs 1,397 - 1,405, with a stop-loss of Rs 1,440 and target of Rs 1,320.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
