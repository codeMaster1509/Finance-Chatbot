    "Motilal Oswal's research report on Asian PaintsAsian Paints (APNT) posted 1%/2% YoY decline in consolidated/standalone revenue in 4QFY24, with decorative volume growth at 10% YoY (vs. est. 9%). The value-to-volume gap expanded to 12% in 4Q from 7% in 3QFY24. Revenue growth was hit by price cuts (3.5% in 4Q), and an unfavorable product mix (subdued growth of the premium segment). Benign raw material prices continue to drive GM, which stood at 43.7% in 4Q, the best in the last 12 quarters. APNT\u2019s gross margin will be the key monitorable in FY25/FY26, considering the changing competitive landscape and dwindling raw material price benefits.OutlookThere are no material changes to our EPS estimates. APNT launched the \u2018Neo Bharat Latex\u2019 paint in Jan\u201924 that penetrated into the unorganized segment with a branded solution, which is smart, affordable, and accessible to consumers. It will address a market size of INR50-55b (management aims to achieve a 30% share in the medium term). With the entry of new players having deep pockets and massive commitments to investments, the overall industry may see a shift in market share and cost structures. These will be the key monitorables for FY25. We remain cautious on both value growth and margin in FY25/FY26. Despite a correction in the stock, the risk of competitive pressure still hovers around its earnings. Consequently, we reiterate our Neutral rating with a TP of INR 3,000 (based on 45x FY26E EPS).For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

    "Sharekhan's research report on Asian PaintsAsian Paints Limited\u2019s (APL\u2019s) Q4FY2024 performance was a miss on all fronts with consolidated revenue coming in flat at Rs. 8,731 crore (affected by value decline), OPM declining by 125 bps y-o-y to 19.4% due to higher media spends, and PAT remaining flat y-o-y at Rs. 1,250 crore. Decorative paints\u2019 volume growth stood at 10% in Q4FY2024. Realisation decline was 12% due to price cut of 3% and downtrading to economy range of products. Volume growth to remain in double-digits, value-volume gap will remain at 5-6%. We expect OPM to remain at the lower end of the guided band of 18-20% due to higher media spends.OutlookAPL\u2019s management is confident of maintaining double-digit volume growth in Q1FY2025 and the quarters ahead, with a sustained recovery in rural demand and small towns. Value growth will remain lower due to mix impact. An expected build-up in competition from newly entered large players would pose a risk to the profitability in the near term. The stock trades at 47x and 42x its FY2025E and FY2026E earnings, respectively. The risk of heightened competition in the core paint segment and its pressure on margin keeps risk reward unfavourable. Hence, we maintain our Hold recommendation on the stock with a revised price target (PT) of Rs. 2,960 (reducing the PT in-line with the reduction in earnings estimates).For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

    "Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Asian PaintsWe cut FY25/26 EPS estimates by 1.2%/2.2% given little scope to improve margins (all time high levels ex of covid year), higher spends on distribution, advertising and supply chain post Grasim\u2019s entry and high capex phase despite sustained double digit volume growth expectations. APNT has launched Neo Bharat latex based emulsion, which can push volumes at the entry-level segment and help boost volume growth. APNT is banking upon its brand equity, strong distribution and innovations to ward off any threat from Birla Opus launch. Domestic outlook remains positive across decorative, Auto and industrial segments while IBD has uncertainty due to Geopolitical issues. Home d\u00e9cor is showing noticeable signs of improvement and it is looking at re-branding kitchen and Bath business under \u201cBeautiful Homes\u201d for improving sales. We believe success of Neo Bharat is a key factor to watch out for as it can boost its market and share at bottom end like it happened post GST. We believe next few quarters are key to gauge impact of Birla Opus on markets and APNT.OutlookAlthough valuations have moderated to 45xFY26 EPS , it does not factor in any significant change in market dynamics and 2.8% EPS CAGR over FY24-26.

    "India\u2019s largest paint manufacturer Asian Paints delivered an earnings show that came under expectations, revenue decreased despite a fall in volumes. Asian Paints reported a consolidated net profit of Rs 1,275.3 crore for the March quarter, posting a rise of 1.3 percent from a year ago.The total revenue stood at Rs 8,730.76 crore, down 0.64 percent from Rs 8,787.34 crore last year, it said in a regulatory filing.The revenue and profit missed estimates. The topline was expected to come in at Rs 9,017 crore for the quarter gone by, according to a Moneycontrol poll of seven brokerages. Profit after tax was expected around Rs 1,313 crore for the March quarter.The EBITA saw a decline as a result of the higher investment in the brand, along with advertisement and promotional spends, per brokerages.However, gross margins expanded 120 basis points on-year to 43.7 percent. \u201cMargins continue to expand amid a softening commodity basket coupled with operational, formulation and sourcing efficiencies,\u201d said Prabhudas Lilladher.Also Read |\u00a0Asian Paints Q4 net profit rises 1.3% to Rs 1,275 crore, revenue down marginallyVolumes see uptickThe volumes saw a growth of ten percent for the quarter as Asian Paints undertook price cuts to boost demand, but it failed to spur revenue. Instead, consumers were downtrading: using cheaper offerings from competitors to fulfill their needs. The value growth will likely lag volume growth as a result of the price cuts taken, said CLSA. Asian Paints saw a double-digit 4Y volume CAGR of 19.4 percent in the decorative business. The business clocked double-digit volume growth in urban areas in Q4.Demand forecastRural markets seem to be picking up, and the company expects Q1FY25 demand to be supported by that sentiment. With a favorable monsoon forecast, wages in the rural segment will see an uptick, leading to increased discretionary spending.Nonetheless, Prabhudas Lilladher said that with the entry of Grasim Industries into the paints business, the outlook on Asian Paints\u2019 near-term prospects remains subdued.However, Motilal Oswal countered that point. The brokerage said, \u201cThe new competition is not bringing any new technology; it is more of a me-too product, playing on discounted pricing. Customers\u2019 loyalty plays a big role in the paints category and Asian Paints has a strong brand recall both at channel and consumer levels.\u201dOutlook\u00a0International brokerage Citi retained 'Sell' on the paints major, with a target price of Rs 2,600 per share.\u00a0 CLSA also retained its 'Sell' call on Asian Paints, cutting its target price of Rs 2,337, from Rs 2,410 earlier.Motilal Oswal said, \u201cWe remain cautious on both value growth and margin in FY25/FY26.

However, this failed to meaningfully increase sales and will weigh on revenue growth for the quarter.Also Read |\u00a0Asian Paints gains as subsidiary signs agreements with GCPL to set up facilityBrokerages expect volume growth to moderate as a result of the increased competitive intensity and slowdown in overall consumption. \u201cDespite implementing price cuts in 4Q, volume has not recovered. We believe that demand remained subdued throughout the quarter,\u201d Motilal Oswal noted.As the cost of raw materials moderates, the gross margin is set to see an expansion. Asian Paints reported an improvement in its formulation efficiencies, which will be partially offset by the recent price correction undertaken across the product portfolio.However, EBITDA margin expansion will remain stable, despite the gross margin expansion on account of higher ad-spends and opex.In the decorative segment, overall demand trends for the industry were muted after a decent Q3, which was aided by festival and marriage demand, said Nuvama Institutional Equities.Some of the key factors to monitor will be the demand outlook in Tier 2 and 3 towns, the outlook for raw materials, pricing actions and the rise in competitive intensity.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "New entrants in the paint sector are unlikely to replicate the extensive distribution network and market penetration achieved by Asian Paints over\u00a0many years, the company's managing director and chief executive officer\u00a0Amit Syngle told Moneycontrol in an exclusive interview. He underscored the company's confidence in maintaining its competitive edge, even in the face of the potential challenges posed by Grasim's entry into the paints business.\"We feel that even if newer players come in and ... look at opening a network..., there is no way they can match this kind of distribution progress in terms of what we have, and the kind of penetration we have across cities,\"\u00a0Syngle said on the sidelines of the launch of Neo Bharat Latex Paint, its first product in a new category of paints.The\u00a0company's\u00a0entry into the new category, which is touted to be an affordable alternative to distemper, aims to democratise the decorative paints sector. It comes more than a month after the Aditya Birla Group-owned Grasim's entry into the paints sector. Grasim's entry, with a Rs 10,000 crore investment, caused brokerages to issue a cautious outlook for Asian Paints amid concerns over increased competition.\u00a0Grasim aims to achieve\u00a0a Rs 10,000 crore gross revenue\u00a0within three years of starting full-scale operations.Asked about the new entrant,\u00a0Syngle\u00a0 said, \"We believe that our strategies are very strong. There have always been new players in the market for the last two decades. There have been international players like Sherwin Williams,\u00a0 which have kind of come into the market with huge investment muscle. So, we feel that it's not a market that is easy to crack, in terms of going forward.\"The sector, which was initially dominated by a few key players, is now seeing more new entrants backed by conglomerates, reflecting the optimism in India's growth story.Syngle added, \"So we feel that the overall market is pretty big ... and it will continue to grow and give space to newer players.\"So far,\u00a0 the potential in the sector has prompted non-paint players such as Birla group's Grasim,\u00a0JSW Group,\u00a0JK Cement,\u00a0 Pidilite, and\u00a0 pipes and fittings manufacturer Astral to venture into the business.Currently, Asian Paints leads the market with over 50 percent market share, followed by\u00a0 Berger Paints with 18%, Kansai Nerolac Paints with 15%, and AkzoNobel (Dulux) with 7%.Big\u00a0bet on rural demandAsian Paints\u00a0announced its entry into a new category of paints,\u00a0an alternative to distemper, on April 15, eyeing growth in the rural markets.Distemper is a preferred option in rural households mainly due to affordability and the traditional preference over emulsion paints. With\u00a0\u00a0the launch of Neo Bharat Latex Paint, Asian Paints is looking to democratise the decorative paints market with lucrative pricing.\"So, this price point is less than Rs 1,000 for a 20 kg pack....it therefore offers a very smart upgrade to the consumer and also a vast range of colors to freely choose from,\"\u00a0Syngle\u00a0 said.\u00a0\n       ",
    "Asian Paints\u00a0launched\u00a0Neo Bharat Latex Paint on April 15, venturing into a new category of paint as robust growth in the sector driven by increasing urbanization, rising disposable incomes, encouraged existing players to tap into the booming demand and lap in more market share.The company, which is the leading player in India, touts the new segment to being affordable, offering over\u00a01,000 shades for consumers.\"Neo Bharat Latex Paint marks one of Asian Paints' most significant launches to date. With this product, we are revolutionizing the industry by introducing a completely new category, making it more accessible to consumers across India,\" said Asian Paints'\u00a0Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Amit Syngle.The company also onboarded cricket player Virat Kohli as the brand ambassador for new launch.\u00a0 \"By penetrating the unorganized segment with a branded solution, we aim to expand the market and drive category growth as a market leader,\" added Syngle.Competition heats up with new players\u00a0The move comes more than a month after Aditya Birla Group-owned Grasim's entry into the\u00a0paints sector with the launch of the company's Birla Opus range of products.\u00a0\u00a0Through the launch of Birla Opus, Grasim aims to secure the second position in the decorative paints market, which is currently dominated by rival Asian Paints.The development caused several brokerages issue a cautious outlook for Asian Paints amid concerns of increased competition.Last month,\u00a0 adhesives major\u00a0Pidilite Industries (PIL) also ventured into the decorative paints market with the debut of Haisha paints.\u00a0 The sector, which was initially dominated by a few key players, is now seeing more new entrants backed by conglomerates, reflecting the optimism about India's growth story.\n       ",
    "Grasim's recently launched paint brand Birla Opus unveiled its dealer pricing which happens to sit at a discount of around 5 percent\u00a0for most products to industry leader Asian Paints. Factoring in promotion volumes, brokerage firm Jefferies noted that the total gap appears to be broadly 10-15 percent across segments except in luxury, where the prices are broadly similar to the market leader.With the discounted offering from Grasim, Jefferies sees the battle intensifying in the Indian paints sector, which also poses a downside risk to market leader Asian Paints. Accordingly, Jefferies expects Asian Paints' earnings-per-stock to remain flattish over the next two years due to a rise in competition and sees downside risk to\u00a0its already\u00a0below consensus' forecasts.Jefferies has an 'underperform' call on Asian Paints with a price target of Rs 2,500, which reflects a downside potential of over 12 percent from the previous close. On the other hand, the firm assigned a 'buy' call for Grasim, with a price target of Rs 2,600 which factors in the scope of around 17 percent upside in the stock.Also Read |\u00a0As Grasim gears up to launch Birla Opus, Jefferies turns bearish on Asian PaintsWell preparedMeanwhile, Jefferies also believes that Grasim has entered the paints segment with full preparation across all fronts.

Its foray into the paint\u00a0industry is expected to shift dynamics within the sector as competition heats up.Through the launch of\u00a0Birla Opus, Grasim aims to secure the second position in the decorative paints market, which is currently dominated by rival\u00a0Asian Paints.The company aims to reach a gross revenue of Rs 10,000 crore within three years of commencing full-scale operations. Grasim has already invested Rs 10,000 crore upfront and commissioned three plants in Panipat, Ludhiana, and Cheyyar in Tamil Nadu.While Grasim's intensive business strategy to make a spot in the paint industry has garnered appreciation from analysts, it has also\u00a0weakened the stronghold for Asian Paints.Several brokerages has issued a cautious outlook for the paints major amid concerns of increased competition which triggered a fall in the stock on February 26. At 09.36 am, shares of Asian Paints were trading 4 percent lower at Rs 2,867.60 on the NSE while those of Grasim Industries were slightly up at Rs 2,201.Anticipating a significant spike in competitive intensity within the sector, brokerage firm CLSA downgraded Asian Paints to a 'sell' and also slashed its price target for the stock by nearly 25 percent to Rs 2,425.\u00a0The brokerage house also cuts its FY25/26 earnings estimates for Asian Paints by 8-10 percent.While the firm remains optimistic about Asian Paints emerging as a leader in the paint industry post the shake-up, it also feels that it is not the guaranteed winner.

Citi has a 'buy' call on Grasim with a price target of Rs 2,650.While the overall consensus doesn't see Grasim's entry dethroning big players in the business, it could still flare up competition and put pressure on pricing, profitability, distribution, and advertising.Macquarie\u00a0doesn't anticipate a sharp spike in discounting levels in the industry either, taking into account Grasim's revenue target for the next three years.

    "Paint stocks came under pressure as Grasim Industries entered\u00a0the space\u00a0with the launch of Birla Opus on February.The flagship Aditya Birla Group company put on stream three paints manufacturing plants - in Panipat, Ludhiana, and Cheyyar - on stream the same day.

While Berger Paints was flat, Asian Paints gained 0.7 percent on the NSE, trading at Rs 3,022.05.Kansai Nerolac shares gyrated between the red and green. The stock price was last quoting Rs 307.35 per share, down 0.15 percent, while Indigo Paints sank 2.5 percent into the red to Rs 1,455.25.The biggest cause for concern for the paints makers has been the Rs 6,000-crore capex that\u00a0Birla Opus has come with. Grasim Industries\u00a0has tapped major advertising firms to market the product and may also tap into their pre-existing distribution network for offerings such as Birla White and UltraTech Cement.Amnish Aggarwal of Prabhudas Lilladher noted that 25 to 30 percent of the paints market belongs to the unorganised sector, which will be \u201ceasy prey\u201d for Birla Opus to snap up. However, even the large, established players will feel the brunt of the increased competition.For paint players, volume growth as well as margins can be impacted. There could be pressure on profitability, as other paint companies increase A&P, raise spends on distribution and trade incentives.Follow our market blog to catch all the live updatesThe current underperformance of Asian Paints is likely to continue, Aggarwal said. The paints major has limited scope to increase prices, while margins will see no expansion due to Asian Paints\u2019 ongoing capex to develop new vertical. With the high valuation, there seems to be little to no room for further growth and therefore, no chance for a re-rating.Birla Opus\u00a0aims at a revenue of Rs 10,000 crore within three years of commencing full-scale operations. Birla, in his speech, announced plans to expand the paints business by setting up 120 depots that will reach out to all cities and cover one lakh people by July.

    "Grasim Industries is all set to break the status quo in the paints industry with its Birla Opus range of products. Kumar Mangalam Birla will launch the business and inaugurate three facilities at Panipat, Ludhiana and Cheyyar.The entry of\u00a0Grasim Industries\u00a0into the paints segment is expected to further intensify competition in the sector. In the first half of the current fiscal year, 49 percent of Grasim Industries capex outlay of Rs 4,900 crore was allocated to the paints business.Grasim announced that it plans on targeting the larger cities first, following which, it will enter the lower-tier markets. The firm in on-boarding deals, finalising ads, signing leases on depots.\u201cGrasim is likely to be a bigger threat, in terms of a new entrant, than players who have announced entry into the paint sector earlier, given the group\u2019s strong distribution reach in cement and putty, because of which Birla Opus, in our view, will be able to garner a strong distribution reaches in the shortest time,\u201d InCred Equities said in a December 2023 report.The consensus in the market is that Grasim will be faced with an uphill task. Smaller players will definitely feel an impact, but Asian Paints is likely to remain unscathed.Follow our market blog to catch all the live updatesInternational brokerage Jefferies noted that while Grasim is eyeing the second spot in the paints market, other companies such as JSW Paints\u00a0and Astral are consistently spending around 15-20 percent on marketing to increase their market share and firm up their presence.\"While success is not guaranteed, the sheer magnitude of this investment by Grasim will likely push the new competitor to adopt an aggressive stance to ramp up,\" said Jefferies. The steps could be higher discounts, promotions for dealers or even painters, which would impact the industry's overall profitability.At 9.45 am, shares of Asian Paints were trading almost 2 percent lower on the NSE at Rs\u00a02,949.8 apiece. Over the past six months, shares have fallen more than 7 percent, as compared to a 14 percent rise in the frontline index Nifty 50.Jefferies retained its 'underperform' rating on Asian Paints\u00a0as the counter has a perplexing valuation of 55x one-year forward PE and has not risen much over the past two years. The target price of Rs 2,500 implied a 17 percent discount from the current market price.According to Amnish Aggarwal of Prabhudas Lilladher, the paints sector has witnessed the entry of multiple players, including MNCs. While speaking to CNBC-TV18,\u00a0Aggarwal said that Grasim has already allocated a significant investment towards this sector, with a capex of Rs 6000 crores by the end of the December quarter. This substantial investment has the potential to exploit distribution channels, such as Birla White and Ambuja, and gain a significant market share, as nearly 25-30% of the industry is still unorganised.Although this move by Grasim may not force big market players out of business, it could put pressure on their profitability if they try to invest in distribution and advertising. Aggarwal believes this development is expected to bring interesting times ahead for the paints industry for the next 12-15 months, a situation that has not been witnessed in the past 20-40 years in the industry.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "With two key events - the Union Budget and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy meeting out of the way, investors will shift focus back to earnings and company fundamentals to choose and invest in quality stocks.Company fundamentals, valuations and growth forecasts are likely to play a greater role in investors' stock selection. Here are seven stocks that still offer solid upside potential of over 30 percent, with reasonable valuations, and robust growth outlook.Adani Enterprises | CMP:\u00a0Rs 3,153Cantor Fitzgerald has a buy call with a target price of Rs 4,369The flagship firm of the Adani Group has started to regain investor confidence after the apex court cleared the air for the company. Experts suggest that risk-reward is in favour of the investors at current levels and the company is the most reliable for bringing energy resources into India (- this needs to be attributed). Its current valuation is largely driven by three main segments namely airports, roads, and its new energy ecosystem. Adani Enterprises shares have jumped over 43 percent in the past three months.HDFC Bank | CMP:\u00a0Rs 1,466CLSA has a buy call with a target price of Rs 2,025Notwithstanding near-term concerns over strain on the lender's net interest margin and sluggish deposits post its mega-merger, HDFC Bank's sharp slump in January has turned its valuations attractive. Analysts say that concerns over deposits and NIMs are an overall industry snag, and not specific to HDFC Bank. Moreover, analysts see the lender as a long-term growth story, with the potential to sail through the near-term headwinds as its merger settles down. HDFC Bank has delivered marginally negative returns in the past three months.PVR Inox | CMP:\u00a0Rs 1,434HSBC has a buy call with a target price of Rs 2,140After a rather dull 2022 for Bollywood, the multiplex company is gradually getting back on its feet. Analysts see light at the end of the tunnel and believe that the content pipeline in CY25 will improve. Global brokerage firm HSBC said that the business fundamentals have stabilised and most concerns are transient. Elara Securities said the company's concerns were overdone, adding that PVR-Inox has a healthy outlook in the medium term. PVR Inox has fallen nearly 10 percent in the past three months.SBI Life Insurance | CMP:\u00a0Rs 1,432BNP Paribas has an outperform rating with a target price of Rs 2,450The life insurer is one of the best bets out there in the insurance space. The company anticipates clocking in robust, industry-beating growth in the medium term, with solid VNB margins, that are likely to stick around 28 percent for FY24. Brokerages are also buying into the management's bullishness as they expect SBI Life to show margin resilience. The cherry on the cake is the stock's underperformance in the past three months, leaving room for a stronger comeback. The stock has gained 7 percent in the past three months, underperforming the benchmark Nifty's 15 percent gains.Cyient | CMP:\u00a0Rs 1,939Morgan Stanley has an overweight call with a target price of Rs 2,700Analysts at Morgan Stanley suggest a robust fourth quarter amid demand visibility in key verticals such as connectivity and aerospace. In the previous quarters, communications bottoming out was a positive for the analysts, who are of the view that the strong performance from different verticals has made the outlook promising. Cyient shares have surged 17 percent in the past three months.Asian Paints | CMP:\u00a0Rs 2,929HSBC has a buy call with a target price of Rs 4,020After a stellar October-December quarter, analysts see the growth outlook as strong, and expect price wars to stabilise in the coming quarters. HSBC believes that fears of competition-based prices are exaggerated. As for the rural demand, the monsoon coupled with an uptick in government spending and moderating inflation is likely to bring in positivity for the rural economy. Asian Paints has lost 0.4 percent in the past three months.Sunteck Realty | CMP:\u00a0Rs 470YES Securities has a buy call with a target price of Rs 586In recent years, Sunteck Realty has showcased an impressive track record of acquiring projects and ramped up its execution capabilities. A strong balance sheet, strong upcoming cash flow and a consolidating market make management optimistic about doubling its under-execution pipeline to Rs 600 bn in 3 years, making the stock a favourite among analysts. Meanwhile, current valuations also make the risk-reward favourable for Sunteck Realty, with new project additions being the key growth drivers. Shares of Sunteck Realty are up 7 percent in the past three months.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
