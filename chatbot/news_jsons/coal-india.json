Since then, the stock has consistently shown upward movement.

Furthermore, the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) study shows rising momentum in positive territory, reinforcing the trend's strength.Looking ahead, we anticipate further upward movement in prices, targeting a level around Rs 3,282. However, it's essential to monitor the Rs 2,474 level closely; sustained price action below this point could invalidate the bullish outlook.Strategy: BuyTarget: Rs 3,282Stop-Loss: Rs 2,474Coal India | CMP: Rs 502Coal India's price structure displays resilience, with a clear uptrend since October 2020, consistently forming higher highs and higher lows.On a weekly scale, the stock demonstrates notable relative strength compared to the broader market.

The RSI shows a bullish cross and stands at 70, indicating robust bullish momentum.Looking forward, we anticipate further upward movement in prices, with a target level around Rs 586. However, it's essential to monitor Rs 461 levels closely; sustained price action below this point could invalidate the bullish outlook.Strategy: BuyTarget: Rs 586Stop-Loss: Rs 461Olectra Greentech | CMP: Rs 1,794Since its 2020 low, the stock has exhibited a classic technical uptrend, consistently forming a classical upward structure. Following each rally, the stock has undergone healthy retracements, and subsequent breakouts have continued to drive rising momentum.Zooming in on recent price action, the stock is on the verge of a triangular pattern breakout. Its recovery from a triple bottom formation on the daily chart indicates an improvement in the trend.On the weekly scale, the stock has been forming a base near the 34-week EMA. Additionally, the stochastic study shows a positive cross, denoting bullish momentum.Looking ahead, we anticipate continued upward movement in the stock, with a potential target price of Rs 2,160.

The stock experienced a breakout from a saucer pattern, which had been forming since October 2019, with volume confirmation. It hit a multi-year high at Rs 467 in February 2024, followed by a correction to Rs 310, where it established a Change in Polarity (CIP) formation, signaling a strong bullish undertone for the medium to long term.In the most recent week, GICRE broke out of a ten-week consolidation and remained above its 20-week SMA, affirming the strength of the uptrend. Rising volumes on every positive move suggest strong participation in the bullish trend.Additionally, the momentum indicator, RSI, is sustaining above 60 and moving upward on the weekly charts, indicating a trend supported by momentum.Looking ahead, further upward movement in prices is anticipated, targeting around Rs 465. However, it's crucial to monitor Rs 320 levels closely, as sustained price action below this point could invalidate the bullish outlook.Strategy: BuyTarget: Rs 465Stop-Loss: Rs 320Shitij Gandhi, Senior Research Analyst (Technicals) at SMC GlobalCipla | CMP: Rs 1,482.3Cipla has been seen trading in a downward-sloping channel and managed to find support near its 200-day exponential moving average (DEMA) on daily charts. The stock formed a Double Bottom pattern around Rs 1,330 levels, indicating a resurgence of bullish momentum thereafter.

    "\"It would be very difficult for Nifty 50 to surpass Friday\u2019s high of 22,795, in the coming week. Even if it does then we expect 22,900 \u2013 22,950 to be a very strong hurdle,\" Mehul Kothari, DVP \u2013 Technical Research at Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers, said in an interview to Moneycontrol.Along with the trendline breakout, Coal India has also confirmed an ascending triangle breakout above Rs 465 mark.\u00a0Hence, the stock is poised for a new life high above Rs 482, he believes.Kothari, who has around 15 years of work experience in technical research, is bullish on Balrampur Chini Mills and DCM Shriram for the coming week.Technically are you bullish on Coal India that has seen a resistance trendline breakout?Along with the trendline breakout, Coal India has also confirmed an ascending triangle breakout above the Rs 465 mark. Hence, the stock seems to be poised for a new life high above Rs 482. However, the theoretical target for the pattern stands around Rs 500 and more whereas the support is placed at Rs 450.Do you expect BHEL to hit record high of around Rs 400 in the coming weeks?That would be too much to ask for in a short-term time frame. It is because BHEL has rallied non-stop\u00a0over the past five quarters. Since the year 2023 the stock has rallied almost 5X from the low of Rs 66. Thus, we expect some profit booking post-election in this stock. For long term, the view remains positive.Do you think the Nifty is likely to give a breakout of current consolidation on the higher side and surpass the 23,000 mark next week?It would be very difficult for Nifty 50 to surpass Friday\u2019s high of 22,795. Even if it does then we expect 22,900 \u2013 22,950 to be a very strong hurdle since that is the higher end of rising channel, which Nifty is respecting for\u00a0the last many months.Even the Nifty Bank index seems to have made a short-term top near that 50,000 milestone. Thus, without the participation of banking stocks it would be a real test for the bulls in the coming week. On the downside, immediate support is placed at Friday's low of 22,348 followed by the 22,200 mark.Is it better to stay away from Nifty IT index for the time being or is it the right time to take exposure to the space?The index has already corrected around 15 percent in past one and a half month and there is no confirmation as of now for a bounce.For the coming week, 31,900 can be the next support for the index which is\u00a0a 78.6 percent retracement of the previous move. On the upside, bounce would get confirmed only above 34,300.Your top 2 bets for next week?Balrampur Chini MillsDuring the week there was an important range breakout in Balrampur Chini above the Rs 396 mark. Along with breaking the range, the stock also confirmed a trendline breakout above the placement of its 200 DEMA (days exponential moving average).Due to the selloff in the markets, the stock has again retested the breakout zone and looks lucrative for long with a short-term time frame.Thus, we advise traders to go long in the stock near Rs 390 with a stop-loss of Rs 379 for the upside target of Rs 412 in the coming week.DCM ShriramAs of now the stock is consolidating just above its 200 DEMA after a rally from Rs 900 levels. There will be a price breakout above Rs 982, which would confirm a bullish FLAG pattern.Above Rs 987, even an Inverse Head and Shoulder pattern would get confirmed.Thus, we advise traders to go long in the stock above Rs 982 with a stop-loss of Rs 950 for the upside target of Rs 1,045 in the coming one to three weeks.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

For the next 40 years at least, coal is going to stay (as a key energy source) in India,\u201d Joshi added.Coal accounts for about three-quarters of India\u2019s power generation and its demand is seen to be rising despite the country\u2019s renewables plans.
