    "Analysts continue to remain cautious about information technology stocks despite some seeing green shoots of recovery for the sector ahead of the Q1 earnings season. As a result, three information technology majors\u2014Wipro, Tech Mahindra, and HCLTech\u2014continue to hold a place on the list of Nifty 50 stocks receiving maximum pessimism from analysts.According to Moneycontrol's Analyst Call Tracker, Wipro tops the list of stocks with the highest \"sell\" calls or maximum pessimism. A total of 23 brokerages have a 'sell' call on the stock, while 13 gave it a 'hold' rating, and only nine rolled out a 'buy' recommendation. This is despite CLSA's recent double upgrade on the stock to 'outperform,' an equivalent to a 'buy' call.Tech Mahindra is another IT major that commands high pessimism, with 24 out of the 46 brokerages covering the stock assigning it either a 'sell' or a 'hold' rating. The Street's stance on HCLTech is similar, with the stock facing 22 'sell' or 'hold' calls compared to 21 'buy' ratings.Recovery still some time awayIT companies have faced a challenging year as businesses in the US, a key market, tightened spending, causing delays in deal conversions for domestic players. Even though a respite is likely to come for the sector towards the end of the current fiscal year, it is still some time away.\u201cA weak exit to FY24 and a still inconducive demand environment could temper initial FY25 guidance for most players,\u201d JM Financial said in a recent note.While the street hopes for a pick-up in discretionary spending through FY25, channel checks and recent peer commentaries suggest no immediate recovery, Axis Securities said. This could potentially lead to some near-term consensus cuts, it added.Also Read |\u00a0Analyst Call Tracker: Pain continues for IT stocksEven though analysts at Nomura believe Q1 FY25 will mark the bottom of sluggish revenue growth for the Indian IT services sector, they still feel that a strong recovery in discretionary demand may take a few quarters. However, a glimmer of hope arises from the fact that the brokerage does not see things worsening for the sector hereon.Regardless of the fact that Nomura has shifted from a 'negative' to 'neutral' stance on the sector, it still remains cautious about turning bullish on Indian IT majors.Uncertainty over rate cutsWhile investors across the globe are hoping to see the Federal Reserve deliver the first rate cut in September, underlying caution on the same still prevails. Analysts also believe that a tight macro environment in the US would delay a recovery for domestic IT players, and hence the US central bank's rate action will remain crucial for the sector.Along with that, analysts also remain watchful of management's commentaries after the Q1 results, to gauge the course of recovery for the IT sector. Management commentaries for major IT companies were not so positive in the previous quarter, further evoking caution among brokerages. Hence, this time around, brokerages would want to see some optimism from the management before shifting their stance on the sector.Also Read |\u00a0Analyst Call Tracker April 2024: Optimism eludes IT stocks despite upgrades, auto stocks see rating cutsDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "A double upgrade by CLSA sent shares of Wipro higher by as much as 4 percent on July 1, making it the top Sensex gainer, with the rating revised from 'Underperform' to 'Outperform' and the target price raised to Rs 607 from Rs 431 per share.The revised price target implies a potential upside of nearly 41 percent from the June 28 closing level.The brokerage firm anticipates no further adjustments to Wipro's FY25 guidance and said it has noted a stabilization in discretionary demand, which is helping the outlook. CLSA expects Wipro to provide Q2 constant currency revenue growth guidance in the range of 0-2 percent.In an exchange filing last month, Wipro had said that a leading US communication services provider has awarded a contract to the company for managed services for some products and industry-specific solutions. The $500 million deal is expected to be spread over a period of five years.Follow our market blog to catch all the live actionWipro's announcement of a $500 million deal this quarter has also been received positively by CLSA. Another brokerage Morgan Stanley had also said that the mega\u00a0US deal can be a positive, especially given\u00a0the tight discretionary spending environment.Aside of Wipro, other IT stocks like Tech Mahindra, LTIMindtree and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) too were trading higher by up to 2 percent, helping the Nifty IT index.Experts point to renewed foreign inflows and optimism surrounding potential US Fed rate cuts as key drivers behind the current rally in IT shares.According to Kranthi Bathini, director of equity strategy at WealthMills Securities, \"Valuations of IT stocks appear very attractive from a long-term perspective.\" Given that Indian IT firms derive a substantial portion of their revenue from US clients, they are particularly sensitive to changes to the US Fed Funds rates.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
