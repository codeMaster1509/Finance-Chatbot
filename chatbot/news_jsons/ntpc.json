    "India's infrastructure and capex boom through projects like the PM Gati Shakti is creating opportunities in the stock market as well, Morgan Stanley said, listing out key names that it is bullish on.Analysts at Morgan Stanley have cited Larsen & Toubro, NTPC, Titagarh Rail Systems and Ultratech Cement as among the key names benefitting from the government spend on infrastructure. The capex boom is also expected to dampen inflation, and boost corporate profitability, according to the analysts.A Morgan Stanley note informed investors that the momentum that India's infrastructure development has seen over the last decade is projected to continue. Analysts expect infrastructure investments to rise from 5.3 percent of GDP in FY24 to 6.5 percent of GDP by FY29, reflecting a robust 15.3 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR). This increase will result in cumulative spending of approximately $1.45 trillion over the next five years, the note said.This surge in infrastructure investment is expected to enhance overall investment rate and foster a period of sustained, high, productive growth.Follow our market blog to catch all the live actionBeneficiaries of India's infra push1. Larsen & Toubro (L&T)According to Morgan Stanley, increased government spend on infrastructure projects would likely benefit L&T significantly. Additionally, a moderation in steel and other material prices could improve the company\u2019s cost structure.An overall improvement in the economy, leading to higher-than-anticipated private capex, would also be a positive driver for L&T.However, a slowdown in government-led infrastructure capex is a key risk for the company's prospects, so is a slowdown in the\u00a0execution cycle which could hamper project completion and profitability. Geopolitical risks could lead to slower execution of projects, and a sharp increase in material costs could squeeze margins.2. NTPCAccording to Morgan Stanley, the potential upside for NTPC includes faster capacity addition driven by stronger power demand and improving health of State Electricity Boards (SEBs), value-accretive acquisitions, and value unlocking in subsidiaries.On the downside, risks involve delays in commissioning, fixed cost under-recovery due to coal or machine availability issues, investments in non-core businesses, and value-decreasing acquisitions.3. Titagarh Rail SystemsFor Titagarh Rail Systems, Morgan Stanley's base case is derived from a target P/E of 35x for September 2026 earnings. This multiple is considered fair, given strong earnings visibility from a large backlog and improving return ratios, which are the best among peers, the foreign brokerage said.An improvement in freight margins and a faster-than-expected ramp-up in passenger coach execution are significant positive drivers for Titagarh. Additionally, an acceleration in passenger segment margins beyond expectations would further enhance the company's financial performance, said analysts.Also Read |\u00a0Goldman Sachs has a Sell on Tata Tech, VinFast reliance a vulnerabilityHowever, supply chain issues could affect the freight business and hamper execution. A slowdown or delay in wagon tendering and ordering for passenger coaches could hurt operating margins.Additionally, delayed execution of contractual obligations could lead to liquidated damages, which would negatively affect the company's financial health.4. Ultratech CementMorgan Stanley believes that despite near-term uncertainties, the medium-term demand visibility for Ultratech Cement remains strong. The brokerage note\u00a0has identified several factors that could drive the stock's performance, including continued demand and a sharp decline in input prices.However, a weaker-than-expected demand offtake is possible if the macroeconomic situation worsens, and a rise in input prices could increase overall costs without corresponding higher realizations, thus denting company's profitability.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "Clean energy firm Jakson Green said on June 19 that it has secured an order from state-owned NTPC to establish a plant for producing 4G ethanol from flue gas. The company has been enlisted as\u00a0the Licensing, Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (LEPC) partner.The project, located in Lara, Chhattisgarh, will produce 10 tons per day (TPD) 4G Ethanol from flue gases.Flue gases are the emissions produced when fossil fuels such as coal, oil, natural gas, or biomass are burned for energy production in industrial processes or power plants. These gases are typically released through a chimney or flue, hence the name \"flue gases.\"Using the carbon capture technology by Veolia Carbon Clean, the plant will capture 25 TPD CO2 from the flue gases, significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, 3 TPD Green Hydrogen will be generated through 7.5 MW Electrolyser.The Plant has been conceptualized & designed by NETRA (NTPC Energy Technology Research Alliance), the R&D arm of NTPC Limited.Jakson Green will spearhead this project targeted for operation within two years, according to the statement.\n       ",

    "Shares of public-sector undertaking companies jumped back into action on June 10, recovering from the selloff in most counters seen early last week. The bounce in these counters can be attributed to the return of PM Narendra Modi to power as he took oath for a third consecutive tenure on Sunday.Names like Power Grid, State Bank of India and NTPC, all state-owned companies, were among the top gainers on the Nifty 50. At 09.43 am, Power Grid was leading gains in the 50-stock index as it traded 3.6 percent higher at Rs 320.35 on the NSE.

    "What do companies like Tata Power, Genus Power, HPL, ABB, Hitachi Energy, and Schneider Electric have in common? Apart from the fact that most of these companies had a great run on the bourses in the past year and belong to the power sector?All these listed companies have a role to play in the growing \u2018smart meter\u2019 segment on which the government is banking to curb power theft and improve billing accuracy, among other things, while also securing accurate, real-time data on power demand.India aims to replace 250 million traditional electricity meters with smart ones by 2025 under the Smart Meter National Programme (SMNP), and this has made the analyst community quite bullish on this segment, as currently only a minor part of the overall target has been met.\u201cIf you look at the opportunity size, it's close to 25 crore meters in the next three-four years,\u201d said Rupesh Sankhe, Senior Research Analyst, Elara Capital.\u201cAs of now, they have just installed close to 1.5 crore smart meters, so the opportunity is plenty. Even at a cost of Rs 6,000-7,000 per smart meter, the market size is close to 1.5 lakh crore,\u201d he adds, while highlighting the fact that the sector has received significant financial incentives, such as central government subsidies, as well.\u201cEach state faces significant T&D (transmission and distribution) losses, and there's a regulatory push to reduce this. The SMNP initiative represents major capital expenditure moving forward,\u201d he adds.Currently, the SMNP rollout is being executed in phases, with an initial focus on high-loss areas and regions equipped with the necessary infrastructure. Projects have already been implemented in states such as Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, and Bihar.Companies like Tata Power, Genus Power, and HPL Electric & Power have, over the past year, won orders for implementing smart meters, while stocks in the segment have given double-digit and multi-bagger returns on the back of growing power demand.Tata Power has gained 98 percent, while Genus Power is up 237 percent. HPL has gained 318 percent, while ABB and Schneider Electric have moved up 102 percent and around 192 percent, respectively, over the last one year.More importantly, despite the high potential for revenue growth, competition remains limited due to the specialised nature of smart meter manufacturing.Also read :\u00a0Power play: Are global stocks a better bet for Indian investors?Analysts believe that the current beneficiaries will feature among the larger players going ahead, as making these meters involves complex technological advancement and smaller players may take some time to develop this technology and attain scale.According to Sankhe, the large, existing players can expand their capacity, ensuring revenue growth.\u201cEven if the current revenue from smart metering is less than 10 percent, the potential is significant. With limited supply, these companies will maintain healthy margins,\u201d he explains.Another play in the smart metering segment could\u00a0be financing entities like REC (Rural Electrification Corporation) and PFC (Power Finance Corporation), which act as nodal agencies for the scheme and play an important role in planning, implementation, and monitoring.Sagar Lele of Rupeeting, a financial advisory firm, however, believes that while there are growth opportunities, it may not be enough for an investment thesis.\u201cWhile smart meters are an essential theme, they should not dominate an investment thesis. The broader energy sector, particularly with infrastructure enhancements and grid automation, offers more significant and immediate opportunities,\" he says.Also read :\u00a0Power not just a domestic theme; data centres, AI to drive next wave of growthGiven the cyclicality of the segment and inherent risks, especially for discoms, a more diversified investment strategy is advisable, says Lele, while citing examples of companies like\u00a0NTPC and Tata Power, which offer a more balanced approach due to their mix of renewable energy and distribution assets.Alchemy Capital's Head-Quant and Portfolio Manager Alok Agarwal concurs. While he remains extremely bullish on the power sector, he, like Lele, sees other opportunities like renewables, etc., within the segment as bigger and better plays for now.Sankhe, however, remains optimistic even as valuations appear high, and attributes the current valuations to the anticipated, sustainable high growth over the next 10-12 years.\u201cThis growth is not just for the initial deployment, but also for the replacement phase. Companies are poised to benefit significantly from this long-term opportunity,\u201d he explains.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on\u00a0Moneycontrol.com\u00a0are their own and not those of the website or its management.\u00a0Moneycontrol.com\u00a0advises users to check with certified experts before taking any investment decisions.

    "State-run power generation company NTPC has shared a more clearer path to unloc value in its renewable energy business, and informed analysts in a concall that it is likely to list NTPC Green by October-November of this year.NTPC Unlocking ValueThe process of tapping the primary market had been underway, and Moneycontrol had reported last month that investment bankers for the proposed Rs 10,000 crore initial public offering had been shortlisted in April. Earlier, in February, Moneycontrol had cited Mohit Bhargava, CEO of NTPC Green stating that the company was aiming to tap the primary market by FY25. \"We are in the process of appointing the merchant bankers and as we see, it's about an eight to nine-month cycle from where we are today, at least, if we are able to finally hit the market,\" Mohit Bhargava told CNBC-TV18 in February 2024.The IPO proceeds are intended to be used to fund ongoing and future projects across solar, green hydrogen and green ammonia, the company had said. At a projected issue size of Rs 10,000 crore, NTPC Green\u2019s IPO will be the biggest initial share sale by a public sector company since the Rs 21,000 crore IPO of Life Insurance Corp. in May 2022.Ambitious OrdersIn the concall with analysts after Q4FY24 results, NTPC said it is targeting new thermal orders worth 15.2 GW in the coming years, and has also raised the ordering pipeline for its thermal capacity. NTPC said it now intends to award 10.4 GW worth of orders for thermal power projects in FY25, which is significantly higher than what was earlier being projected.In terms of commissioning as well, NTPC said it expects commissioning of thermal power projects worth 2.8 GW in FY25, and 1.5 GW for FY26.Brokerage View\u00a0Given NTPC\u2019s 25 percent share in India\u2019s power generation and the country\u2019s plan to add 30\u201340GW of RE a year, Nuvama argues that the PSU is poised to maintain its market share without requiring external equity.Track NTPC's Earnings fineprint hereAbout NTPC GreenNTPC Green was incorporated in April 2022 as a wholly owned subsidiary of NTPC to consolidate the parent company's renewable energy assets.\n       ",

    "Shares of National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) gained on May 27 as brokerages maintained bullish calls on the stock despite the PSU reporting below-estimate earnings for the quarter ended March 2024.Morgan Stanley has maintained its 'overweight' call on NTPC, setting a target price of Rs 390 per share. The brokerage noted that the company's recent earnings report fell short of estimates primarily due to fixed cost under-recoveries.Its consolidated profit after tax (PAT) was also below expectations, largely driven by reduced profit contributions from subsidiaries.Despite this, the company boasts a robust renewable energy (RE) portfolio, totaling 23.2 GW, said Morgan Stanley, adding that there is speculation that a renewable energy (RE) IPO could be on the horizon, possibly occurring by October or November 2024.At 9:18 am, NPTC shares were trading around a percent higher at Rs\u00a0378.40 on the National Stock Exchange (NSE).Follow our market blog to catch all the live actionIndia's largest integrated power utility's consolidated net profit for Q4FY24 jumped 33 percent on year amid higher power demand due to scorching high temperatures in the country.The state-run company's revenue from operations also rose over 7 percent YoY in the March quarter. The company\u2019s power generation and coal production also increased in the period.According to analysts at Nuvama Institutional Equities, NTPC is a distinctive play on thermal demand and transitioning towards renewable energy, aided by its size and profitability. Thermal is still the mainstay but all future capacity addition is based on renewable energy with a target of 6GW per annum, it noted.\"NTPC currently has most of its operational capacity (standalone) under the regulated model. This enables it to pass on increase in costs, limiting the impact on profitability,\" the brokerage said.According to Nuvama analysts, NTPC\u2019s thermal profitability shall likely improve, given: i) no significant fuel-based under recoveries; ii) improving PLFs; iii) accelerated commissioning; and iv) higher incentives.NTPC\u2019s RE focus is the mainstay given its unique advantage to leverage its thermal plants to blend-in RE; ready access to human and financial capital; and risk framework, which protects against the downside.\"Further, the thermal giant\u2019s transition towards new energy encompasses decarbonisation of industrials and mobility, not just RE.While the existing business earns regulated RoEs of 18-19 percent on invested equity (including incentives), the RE capex is on a competitive bidding basis, wherein NTPC\u00a0enjoys a 1\u20131.5 percent lower cost of debt (versus private sector peers) given its balance sheet size and near-sovereign status. \"This enables higher IRRs despite competitive tariffs,\" said Nuvama.Given NTPC\u2019s 25 percent share in India\u2019s power generation and the country\u2019s plan to add 30\u201340GW of RE a year, Nuvama argues that NTPC is poised to maintain its market share without requiring external equity.The domestic brokerage maintained its 'buy' rating on the stock but revised the target price upwards to Rs 435 from Rs 367 earlier.Also Read |\u00a0NTPC net profit jumps 33% amid increased power demand.

    "Norway\u2019s central bank has excluded Adani Group\u2019s port firm, APSEZ from its government pension fund over ethical concerns, making it the 15th Indian company to face such action with previous ones being the likes of ONGC, GAIL, NTPC and Vedanta. Norges Bank, which manages the sovereign wealth fund, on May 15 stated that it has decided to exclude Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone due to \u201dunacceptable risk that the company contributes to serious violations of individuals\u2019 rights in situations of war or conflict.\u201dAPSEZ, which was on the central bank\u2019s watch list for possible exclusion from investment since March 2022, faced the action due to its business association with the armed forces in Myanmar. Sources however said the Adani group firm sold the Myanmar asset entirely in May last year, and there has been no incremental disclosures made regarding that asset, as the company has fully exited.The Norwegian fund\u2019s Council of Ethics acknowledged APSEZ\u2019s May 2023 disclosure that it had sold its port-related operations in Myanmar to Solar Energy Ltd but said \u201dno information on buyer is available, and APSEZ has stated that it cannot share any such information on the grounds of confidentiality.\u201d\u201dLack of information means that the Council cannot establish whether APSEZ has links to the enterprise concerned. In a situation in which extremely serious norm violations are taking place, this constitutes an unacceptable risk that the Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global\u2019s (GPFG\u2019s) investments in APSEZ may breach its ethical guidelines,\u201d it added.The Norwegian Fund started buying into APSEZ in mid-October, post the May 2023 disclosure. It made near 70 per cent on its first purchase in nearly 6 months, until it exited in April. APSEZ joins more than a dozen Indian firms which had faced similar action over the past few years, according to information on the website of Norges Bank Investment Management.The Norwegian bank had excluded ITC in January 2020 over production of tobacco. Similar action followed against Zuari Agro Chemicals in October 2013 over alleged human rights violations. Vedanta faced similar action in January 2014 over \u2019severe environmental damage\u2019.Coal India, NTPC, Reliance Power, Tata Power and three other power producers faced a similar action in April 2016 for production of coal or coal-based energy. BHEL faced action in May 2017 and January 2023 over environmental damage and sales to states in armed conflicts.Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) was charged with serious violations of individuals\u2019 rights in situations of war or conflict when it faced similar action in September 2021.
