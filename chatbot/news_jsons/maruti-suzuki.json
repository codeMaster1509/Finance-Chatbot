    "Motilal Oswal's research report on Maruti SuzukiSuzuki\u2019s manufacturing principle: smaller, fewer, lighter, shorter, beauty Suzuki, the parent company of Maruti Suzuki India (MSIL), has unveiled its next 10-year technology strategy aimed at achieving minimal energy consumption throughout the lifecycle of its products. This goal will be pursued through the principles of Sho-Sho-Kei-Tan-Bi, a Japanese abbreviation for \u201csmaller, fewer, lighter, shorter and beauty.\u201d The strategy encompasses five strategic approaches: 1) the development of a \u201clight-weight yet safe vehicle\u201d as the core foundation, 2) the design of \u201clean-battery EV and HEV\u201d with optimized materials to meet consumer needs, 3) the integration of \u201chigh-efficiency ICE with CNF,\u201d 4) the implementation of \u201cSDV right\u201d for value creation through cost-effective systems, and 5) the promotion of \u201ceasy recyclability and disassembly design\u201d to support a circular economy. Some of the focus areas are: 1) further working on weight reduction of 100kg for the next 10 years; 2) in EVs and hybrids, using minimum necessary batteries without excess in order to ensure energy efficiency; and 3) working toward a circular economy. Suzuki believes hybrid cars are the best choice until non-fossil based electric energy usage becomes fully widespread. Accordingly, MSIL has embraced a multi-tech approach (working on CNG, flex fuels, hybrids, and EVs) to achieve its emission targets. It is probably the only company in India to be working on diverse technologies to suit Indian consumer needs. MSIL continues to be our top pick in Auto OEMs with a TP of INR14,440 (premised on 26x June-FY26E EPS).OutlookWe expect MSIL to post a 13% earnings CAGR over FY24-26. Besides, any government incentives for hybrid or CNG or flex fuels are likely to lead to a re-rating of MSIL in the future. The stock trades at 26x/23x FY25E/FY26E consolidated EPS. We reiterate our BUY rating on MSIL with a TP of INR14,440 (premised on 26x June-FY26E EPS).For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

The note added that the move\u00a0is expected to benefit Maruti significantly, potentially leading to more hybrid model launches, backing it with a\u00a0Buy rating with a target price of Rs 15,100 per share.Citi maintains Maruti as its top sector pick, anticipating further volume growth if other states follow the UP government's lead.Follow our market blog to catch all the live actionMorgan Stanley has an overweight call on Maruti\u00a0with a target price of Rs 14,105 per share. The brokerage said the\u00a0policy support points to having a diversified portfolio of powertrains as the best strategy in the automotive sector.The sizable incentive by the State government\u00a0for hybrid cars is a notable boost, it noted.\u00a0\"This move by UP could inspire other states to adopt similar incentives. Consequently, a portfolio of powertrains, including hybrids, deserves a premium valuation,\" Morgan Stanley added in its note.Macquarie has maintained a Neutral call on Maruti with a target price of Rs 11,565 per share. The reduction in road tax on strong hybrid vehicles by the UP government is seen as a sentiment-positive for the company.This policy reduces the price premium for strong hybrids over internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles to 10 percent from 20 percent, Macquarie said.Some estimates suggest that the registration waiver could reduce the on-road price of hybrid cars by up to Rs 4 lakh.

    "Maruti Suzuki India plans to utilise Indian Railways to transport 35 per cent of the vehicles produced across its factories over the next 7-8 years, according to MD and CEO Hisashi Takeuchi.The share of vehicle dispatches through railways scaled to 21.5 per cent in the 2023-24 fiscal from 5 per cent in 2014-15.The country's largest carmaker's vehicle dispatches through railways increased from 65,700 units in 2014-15 to 4,47,750 units in 2023-24.\"With our production capacity nearly doubling from about 2 million units to 4 million units by FY 2030-31, we plan to augment the use of railways in vehicle dispatches, close to 35 per cent over the next 7-8 years,\" Takeuchi stated.Maruti Suzuki has so far dispatched over 20 lakh units through Indian Railways. The automaker ferries vehicles to 20 destinations, serving over 450 cities using Indian railways.Takeuchi said the company pioneered the use of railways for vehicle dispatches over a decade ago by becoming the first company in India to obtain the Automobile-Freight-Train-Operator license.Since then, the company has systematically increased its share of vehicle dispatches using railways, he added.\"Through our sustained efforts in green logistics, we have achieved outstanding results including cumulative reduction of 10,000 metric tonne of CO2 emissions and 270 million litre of cumulative fuel savings,\" Takeuchi noted.The company stands committed to the country's net zero emissions target by 2070, he added.Earlier this year, under the PM Gati Shakti programme, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the country's first automobile in-plant railway siding at Maruti Suzuki's Gujarat facility.This facility has a capacity to dispatch 3 lakh vehicles per annum.The next in-plant railway siding is in progress at the company's Manesar facility and will be operational soon, the automaker stated.\n       ",
    "Automobile major Tata Motors emerged as the top bet within the sector as it topped the list of stocks that garnered the maximum upgrades from analysts in June. On the other hand, rival Maruti Suzuki saw downgrades in the same tenure. Optimism for Tata Motors is emerging from its plans to demerge the commercial vehicles business into one entity and consolidate the passenger vehicles, including PV, EV, and JLR, into another entity.According to Moneycontrol's Analyst Call Tracker, 'buy' calls for Tata Motors rose to 23 in June as against 20 in the month prior. Along with that, 'sell' and 'hold' calls reduced by one each during the month. On the flipside, rival Maruti Suzuki saw 'buy' calls reduce to 31 in June from the prior 33 while 'sell' and 'hold' ratings rose by one each.Tata Motors' demerger to unlock valueTata Motors' plans to demerge its businesses into two separate entities are seen as a welcome move by analysts. \"Post demerger, Tata Motors' PV business will include both the domestic EV segment and the Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) business. Consequently, its separately listed PV stock will provide an opportunity to invest in both the domestic passenger vehicle market and the global premium passenger vehicle segment,\" Sharekhan stated in a note.Based on this, Sharekhan also believes that the demerger will give investors yet another option to play on the mass-market PV growth story. Accordingly, the firm believes that though rival Maruti Suzuki may still sustain its leadership position in the PV segment, it may not have its TINA (there is no alternative) tag among investors for long. \"Thus, considering the structural positive view on PV segment, we now prefer Tata Motors over Maruti Suzuki,\" Sharekhan said.Meanwhile, Tata Motors also chalked out its plans to raise its market share in passenger vehicles (PVs) and increase its non-vehicle revenues in commercial vehicles (CVs), yet another move that sparks optimism among analysts.Analysts at Jefferies also noted that in PVs, Tata intends to increase its market share from 14 percent in FY24 to 16 percent in FY27 and 18-20 percent by FY30. In CVs, it intends to gradually increase its market share and deliver strong double-digit EBITDA margins.Premiumisation, Hyundai India IPO- a worry for Maruti SuzukiAnalysts at Sharekhan highlighted that even though the PV segment is expected to grow by single digits in FY25, the demand for entry-level models stays lukewarm as it continues to be skewed toward high-end products.Given that Maruti Suzuki represents a classic play on the mass-market PV growth story, the rising trend of premiumisation may moderate its earnings growth, analysts believe.In addition, the much-awaited initial public offer of Hyundai India also gives investors another option to bet on India's growing PV story, implying increased competition for Maruti Suzuki's stock. In addition, the 17.5 percent surge in shares of Maruti Suzuki in the year so far also prompted analysts to be cautious over prospects of a further upside.Also Read |\u00a0Analyst Call Tracker April 2024: Optimism eludes IT stocks despite upgrades, auto stocks see rating cutsHence, even though the company's growth trajectory remains intact, analysts choose to prefer other rivals due to the availability of better options.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "Amidst soaring temperatures and hefty discount offerings by auto dealers, Passenger Vehicle (PV) wholesales during June 2024 witnessed\u00a0 3.67 percent growth at 3,40,784 units as against 3,28,710 units dispatched during June 2023.While the high base effect of last year also resulted in modest growth in volumes, industry players reckon that new launches such as as Maruti Suzuki Swift, Hyundai Creta, etc., continued to contribute to incremental volumes.During the first half of this year, the total sales by PV makers stood at 21,68,512 units, which is 7.6 percent more than 20,15,033 units sold during during corresponding period last year.The country\u2019s largest passenger vehicles maker Maruti Suzuki India (MSIL) reported domestic wholesales of 1,37,160 units in June, up by 3.10 per cent from 1,33,027 units in the same month last year.According to Partho Banerjee, Senior Executive Officer, Marketing & Sales, MSIL,\u00a0the growth in the PV industry is majorly on the back of the new models that are gaining a lot of traction.\u201cWe have managed to sell 35,815 units of the all-new Swift since its launch in early May. Last month itself, we sold 16,000 units despite last month\u2019s production maintenance shutdown,\" revealed Banerjee.Similarly, IPO-bound Hyundai Motor India (HMIL) reported a marginal growth in its domestic wholesales to 50,103 units during the month as compared with 50,001 units in the same month last year.\"We closed H1 of CY2024 with an overall sales growth of 5.68 per cent year-on-year. SUVs have contributed strongly, accounting for 66 per cent of our domestic sales,\" Hyundai Motor India COO Tarun Garg said in a statement.Tata Motors stated that the sales of passenger vehicles, including electric vehicles, in the domestic market, were lower by 8 percent at 43,624 units in June as compared with 47,359 units in the year-ago month.\"Going forward, we foresee recovery of demand, as enquiries have remained strong despite low retails in the past two months. This strong enquiry pipeline, in addition to the onset of festive season from August, augurs well for the industry,\" Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Managing Director Shailesh Chandra said in a statement.Mahindra and Mahindra\u2019s (M&M) passenger vehicle sales in the domestic market rose 23 percent to 40,022 units last month against 32,588 units in June last year.According to Veejay Nakra, President, Automotive Division, M&M Ltd., \u201cJune has been a momentous month, as we rolled out the 200,000th XUV700 from our facility.\u201dKia India recorded sales of 21,300 units in June 2024, marking 9.8 percent Y-O-Y growth compared to the 19,391 units sold in June 2023.Hardeep Singh Brar \u2013 Senior Vice President and National Head Sales & Marketing said, \"We have observed a healthy month-on-month sales growth in H1 2024, averaging over 21,000 units per month.\u201dToyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) stated that its domestic wholesales stood at 25,752 units, while exports accounted for 1,722 units.\"Our SUV and MPV segments continue to lead our impressive sales surge thus reflecting a strong consumer preference for these versatile and reliable vehicles,\" Toyota Kirloskar Motor Vice President, Sales-Service-Used Car Business, Sabari Manohar said in a statement.Honda Cars India Limited (HCIL) reported a 5 percent decline in wholesales in the domestic market to 4,804 units in June. The Japanese carmaker\u00a0had dispatched 5,080 units to its dealers in the domestic market in June 2023.JSW MG Motor India reported a 9 percent year-on-year decline in retail sales at 4,644 units in June.\n       ",
    "India's largest car marker\u00a0Maruti Suzuki\u00a0reported strong double-digit sales growth in June, selling 1.79 lakh units which was higher by 12.4 percent compared to a year ago.The strong show in June was backed by a 57 percent year-on-year rise in total export sales at 31,033 units.Shares of Maruti Suzuki were higher by 0.6 percent at 2:40pm, broadly in line with benchmark Sensex.Maruti's total domestic Passenger Vehicle sales (PV) was at 1.37 lakh units, marginally higher compared to a year ago. This includes Utility Vehicles such as Brezza, Ertiga, Fronx, Grand Vitara and Jimny, hinting as stiff competition in the UV space, especially from M&M.M&M's Investor Day presentation in June had shared plans to introduce six new SUVs by 2030, and a total of 23 launches by 2030. Investors have been very bullish on M&M stock given its promising growth outlook and a potential recovery in the farm equipment business for FY25. June also saw M&M and Tata Motors locked in an intense battle of market capitalisation, with\u00a0M&M briefly overtaking Tata Motors\u00a0to become India's second most valuable automobile company.However, the mid-sized segment of sedans and compact cars found fewer takers in June this year compared to a year ago. This segment contract in June as well in Q1FY25, with both Alto and the S-Presso models selling less than 9,400 units in June 2024, as compared to 14,054 units a year ago. Sale of compact cars such as Baleno, Celerio, Dzire, Ignis, Swift and WagonR was also lower, at 64,049 units in June, compared to 64,471 units a ago.\n       ",
    "Grappling with prolonged stock holding periods and sluggish sales, auto dealers have asked car makers to delay vehicle dispatches to reduce inventory pile-up at their end. While average inventory levels have averaged 40-42 days for a long time, it has increased to 60 days over the past three months.This surplus has heightened worries about increased interest costs and financial pressure on dealerships.\u201cDuring the last festive season, dealers received inventory stocks covering more than 60 days. Subsequently, we have been urging OEMs and have even written to SIAM to reduce the dispatch of stocks,\" Manish Raj Singhania, president of the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations, told Moneycontrol.While expressing concerns over the rising inventory levels of passenger vehicles at dealerships, Singhania said that FADA will also reach out to its industry counterpart, Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), to advise its members to moderate the unrestricted inflow of vehicle stocks.\u201cOver the last three months, we have seen a steady rise in inventory, and in May, we closed with 55 to 60 days of inventory. That is equivalent to 550,000 to 600,000 vehicles for a two-month stock,\u201d Singhania added. He foresees similar stock levels at the end of June.Explaining the predicament, Singhania stated that auto dealers constantly secure loans to finance vehicle stocks bought from OEMs. These loans come with interest payments meant to be repaid within 60 days.According to the data collated by FADA, PV retail sales during April and May totalled 638,481 units, up by 7.24 percent from 595,361 units registered in the corresponding period last year. Similarly, total PV wholesalers during April and May were 685,886 units, just a 1.26 percent increase from 666,714 units sold during the same period last year, according to SIAM data.Based on this data, the total number of unsold stocks stood at 47,405 units as of June 1, 2024, compared to 71,353 units in the same period last year. While the gap narrowed between PV wholesale and retail figures, the inventory period nearly doubled to 60 days.A spokesperson for SIAM did not comment on the queries sent by Moneycontrol.The FADA president stated that wholesale figures for all segments, including SUVs, have stabilised recently. \u201cWith the waiting period for SUVs over, all vehicles, except for a few variants, are available off-the-shelf at dealerships,\u201d Singhania noted.He also said that OEMs need to strike a balance between production levels and demand to prevent overstocking of cars, particularly in the hatchback and sedan segments. \u201cOEMs should bill vehicles according to the retail figures in the market. They should not overbill dealers by pushing stocks of low-demand vehicles.\u201dInventory period extendsSinghania also revealed that OEMs have been pushing banks, which offer vehicle financing solutions, to extend the revolving credit facility provided to dealers to 90 days to facilitate holding higher levels of inventory. He also claimed that OEMs are urging dealers to extend the tenure of this financing scheme to 90 days, with dealers bearing the additional interest costs.\u201cWhile dealers are getting an additional month, this scheme enables OEMs to offload more stocks. This would further burden dealerships with interest costs and excess stock,\u201d Singhania\u00a0noted. \"If they are extending the financing period, they should introduce a scheme to cover the extra interest costs.\u201d In his view, a 30-day inventory level is manageable.Responding to a query from Moneycontrol, India\u2019s largest car maker Maruti Suzuki stated that it has a stock level of 35 to 36 days, which it considers \"manageable\".\u00a0 The company said that its current inventory pipeline totalled 168,000 units as of early June, and the company does not intend to take any measures to further reduce that count.\u201cWe have a network stock of 30-35 days, including transit time. This is neither too high, nor too low, as we are averaging monthly wholesale numbers of 147,000 units. The current levels are also pretty normal, and we do not feel under pressure,\u201d Partho Banerjee, senior executive officer\u00a0of marketing and sales\u00a0at MSIL, said on June 1.Hyundai Motor India Limited (HMIL) stated that it had an inventory of 44,774 units in early June. \u201cWith average monthly sales of 50,000 units, our inventory is less than four weeks. We take pride in maintaining optimal inventory in our network. We have always done so and plan to continue,\u201d said Tarun Garg, chief operating officer of Hyundai Motor India (HMIL), earlier this month.\n       ",
    "India's market has grown substantially, attracting truly global funds with the ability to invest anywhere in the world. In the past, during the peak of China's market, global funds typically held two or three China e-commerce internet stocks in their portfolios.However, this trend has largely changed, with global investors now favouring one, two, or three mega-cap Indian stocks, according to Jonathan Garner, Chief Equity Strategist for Asia and Emerging Markets at Morgan Stanley.\"This shift has already begun and is expected to accelerate,\" Garner told Moneycontrol in an interview.

Previously, when India constituted a smaller segment, it was often overlooked.However, with India now positioned as the second-largest market in emerging markets and poised to become the largest, global investors cannot afford to disregard its significance, emphasised Garner.He further highlighted several pockets of growth within the Indian market. \"What we like particularly is domestic demand plays,\" he explained. This includes sectors like consumer discretionary, industrials, financials, and real estate.Notably, real estate, a sector previously not recommended for exposure in India, is now gaining momentum.Garner expressed bullishness on specific stocks including ICICI Bank, Maruti Suzuki, GAIL, and Godrej Properties in real estate. In contrast, Morgan Stanley is more cautious on externally earning sectors such as IT services, outsourcing names, pharmaceuticals, and defensive stocks, though they are not in a defensive posture on India overall.The analyst noted a recent shift in sentiment towards consumer and IT stocks post-election, as opposed to infrastructure, capital goods, and other economy-sensitive stocks.With a significant CapEx cycle in recent years, Garner anticipates a continued emphasis on infrastructure but expects the focus to gradually shift towards consumer-driven sectors, which offer a robust environment and a wide range of investment opportunities.Also Read |\u00a0India poised to replace China as largest market in EM index: Morgan Stanley's Jonathan GarnerJonathan Garner's insights underscore the evolving landscape of India's market development and sectoral preferences.

    "Indian automobile majors Maruti Suzuki and Eicher Motors fell prey to brokerages' axe in April, becoming the two most downgraded stocks during the month owing to a tepid outlook and concerns over demand moderation.In April, Maruti Suzuki saw a decline in positive recommendations from analysts, with 34 buy calls compared to 41 in March, alongside\u00a0nine hold calls (up from six) and\u00a0three sell calls (unchanged). Similarly, Eicher Motors experienced a shift in sentiment, with 17 analysts recommending a buy (down from 19 in March), 13 suggesting to hold, and 11 advising to sell their stocks during the same period.In April, Maruti Suzuki shares gained nearly\u00a0two percent while the Eicher Motors stock surged over 14 percent.ALSO READ:\u00a0Analyst Tracker: Wipro stock sees maximum pessimism in April on weak IT outlookMaruti treads on bumpy roadFollowing Maruti's strong Q4 results on April 26, a slew of brokerages issued bearish views on the country's leading four-wheeler automobile manufacturer, since the earnings were mostly priced in.Domestic brokerage Kotak Institutional Equities has issued a 'sell' call on the Maruti Suzuki stock with a price target of Rs 10,500, a downside of over 17 percent from the last closing price. Analysts suggest that the volume trajectory is likely to remain muted over FY25.Further, they said that the company's volume trajectory in the small and SUV segment is likely to decline. \"We expect market share to slip to about 40.5-41 percent owing to newer launches by competitors,\" said a Kotak research note.The company\u00a0reported a 48 percent rise in its net profit to Rs 3,878 crore for the fourth quarter led by higher sales volume and favourable commodity prices.

The firm noted that Royal Enfield is moving from a period of strong growth with high margins to one of slower growth with high margins maintained. They suggested that current valuation multiples seem expensive when considering long-term growth potential.However, just like its competitors, the company remains positive about volume growth in the fiscal year 2025. The brokerage raised the target price to Rs 3,533 significantly lower than the current market price of Rs 4,657.Analysts also suggest that short-term challenges are anticipated for the VECV business, a joint venture with Volvo, attributed in part to ongoing elections and a slowdown in infrastructure projects. This results in limited upside potential for the stock,\u00a0suggesting\u00a0that its current price already factors in the positive market share momentum, recent product launches, and a recovery in exports.In a recent report, Nuvama Institutional Equities maintained its 'hold' call on the\u00a0Eicher Motors stock. Royal Enfield (RE) is facing intense competition from global brands, and that is likely to sustain, Nuvama predicts, expecting underperformance to persist with a moderate volume CAGR of 5 percent in the domestic market over FY24\u201326.Analysts at Elara Securities suggest that RE may lose market share in the premium segment in FY23-26, amid launches by peers. The contribution share of existing RE customers upgrading to a new RE may not rise significantly, and any major outperformance versus industry growth is unlikely. Thus, premium valuation at 20-70 percent versus peers is unjustified.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
