    "Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) has intensified operations to increase gas production in Tripura to feed power generation plants in the northeastern state, an official said on Monday.The decision comes amid reports of a reduction in gas supply to various gas-based power generation plants in the state.ONGC produced 1,527 million standard cubic metres (MMSCM) of gas in Tripura in the 2023-24 fiscal, while it has set a target of extracting 1,675 MMSCM gas in the current fiscal.\"ONGC has been working to increase gas production so that sufficient gas is supplied to the gas-based power plants in Tripura. We have already set a target of extracting 1,675 MMSCM of gas during the current fiscal year (2024-25) while the production was 1,527 MMSCM in 2023-24,\" ONGC's Tripura Asset Manager Krishna Kumar told PTI.He said that ONGC will dig as many as 20 new wells for gas exploration in the financial year 2024-25 and one more rig will be added shortly to boost the exploration drive. At present, six rigs are being used by ONGC to explore natural gas in the northeastern state.Besides new exploration, ONGC has also initiated the process of cluster drilling to extract gas using old well sites as existing wells already have facilities and approval for exploration.\"Due to rapid urbanisation in Tripura, ONGC is focusing on cluster drilling to extract gas by using old wells because facilities are already available there. Also, we don't need to get fresh approval from the state for gas exploration or extraction in those sites. There is also no need to acquire land which has become a costly affair,\" he said.Emphasising the issue of proper utilisation of gas, Kumar said if one of the units of the Palatana power plant in the state shuts down for any reason, the gas supply becomes surplus, causing loss to ONGC.\"If gas becomes surplus due to the shutdown of any plant, it becomes a problem because other plants operating in the state do not have the capacity to receive the surplus gas. It causes loss to the ONGC,\" he said.Various state-run agencies operate the gas-based power plants in Tripura.\n       ",
    "ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas investment arm of state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), has acquired Norwegian firm Equinor's stake in an Azerbaijan oilfield and an associated pipeline for USD 60 million, the firm said in a statement.OVL \"has signed a definitive sale purchase agreement (SPA) for directly acquiring 0.615 per cent participating interest (PI) in offshore Azeri Chirag Gunashli (ACG) oil field in Azerbaijan from Equinor. The agreement also includes acquiring 0.737 per cent shares of the Baku Tbilisi Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline company through its wholly-owned subsidiary ONGC BTC Limited,\" it added.The acquisitions, expected to be completed in the upcoming months, involve a total investment of up to USD 60 million.OVL currently has a 2.31 per cent stake in the ACG field and 2.36 per cent in the BTC pipeline. The buyout of Equinor will help raise its stake.Equinor, in December last year, announced an agreement to sell all its remaining assets in Azerbaijan to SOCAR (State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic).The assets comprised a 7.27 per cent non-operated interest in the Azeri Chirag Gunashli oil fields in the Azerbaijan sector of the Caspian Sea, 8.71 per cent interest in the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline and 50 per cent in the Karabakh field.SOCAR already held a 25.0 per cent stake in ACG, a 25.0 per cent stake in BTC via Azerbaijan BTC Limited, and 50 per cent in Karabakh.It is not clear how Eqinor, which had agreed to sell all of its stake to SOCAR, ended up selling a 0.615 per cent stake in the oilfield and a 0.737 per cent stake in the pipeline. The statement made no mention of this.Originally, OVL acquired a 2.72 per cent stake in ACG in March 2013.ACG contract extension till 2049 was signed between field partners and SOCAR in September 2017. As per the restated and amended production sharing agreement (PSA) for the extension period, the stakes of international oil companies were reduced with OVL's interest becoming 2.31 per cent from 2.72 per cent.BP is the operator of the field with a 30.37 per cent stake. The remaining stake in the field is divided between Japanese firms and ExxonMobil.\"ACG is a super-giant offshore oil field in the Caspian Sea operated by oil major BP since 1999. The field has been developed in phases, and a seventh production platform, Azeri Central East, has been commissioned in early 2024,\" the statement said.Baku-Tbilisi Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline carries oil from the Azeri-Chirag-Deepwater Gunashli (ACG) field and condensate from Shah Deniz across Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkiye. It links the Sangachal terminal on the shores of the Caspian Sea to the Ceyhan marine terminal on the Turkish Mediterranean coast.OVL holds a stake in 32 oil and gas projects in 15 countries, ranging from Vietnam to Venezuela. It currently produces some 2,00,000 barrels of oil and oil equivalent natural gas per day from these assets.\n       ",
    "Shares of Oil and Natural Gas Corp\u00a0are trading higher after Reuters\u00a0reported citing industry source that India's largest oil and gas exploration company\u00a0has sought a waiver from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control to lift crude oil from Venezuela.The report said ONGC is optimistic of winning an\u00a0approval, according to a source who declining to be named.Earlier this year, US had reimposed sanctions on Venezuela citing that the country had broken an accord to hold free and fair elections.India and even American oil refiners had increased imports of Venezuelan oil in 2023 after a six-month waiver from sanctions was announced, which ended in April this year. Oil from Venezuela was among the cheapest for India's oil refiners, with average landed cost reported at $60.60 a barrel in January this year.The Reuters report added that ONGC has been hopeful of\u00a0recovering $500 million worth of dividends pending since 2014 for the stake it holds in Venezuelan projects.\u00a0ONGC has instead\u00a0sought oil instead of the pending dividend, however there has not been much progress on that front so far.Crude oil has rallied this year\u00a0helped by supply cuts by OPEC+, though a volatility has declined to multi-year lows in June.\n       ",

    "State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is seeking help from an internationally-proven technical service provider to raise oil and gas production from its flagship but old and maturing Mumbai field in the Arabian Sea.The firm has floated an international tender to identify the service provider who will help raise production from the field, ONGC said in a post on X. \u201dThe giant multi-layered Mumbai High field, which commenced production 48 years ago in 1976, is currently in its mature stage of production and ONGC has implemented a number of schemes in this field to improve production,\u201d it said.\u201dAs a custodian and operator of Mumbai High field, ONGC is keen to collaborate with a global technical service provider. The service provider would be contracted for 10 years, extendable by another five years.\u201d Mumbai High field lies 160 kilometres off the coast of Mumbai and produces about 38 per cent of India\u2019s oil production. While it hit a peak output of 40,000 barrels per day in 1989, the field is producing 134,000 bpd and about 10 million standard cubic metres per day of gas.The field is estimated to hold a balance reserve of 80 million tonnes (610 million barrels) of oil and over 40 billion cubic metres of gas. The service provider would give technical solutions for raising the output. It will be paid a fixed fee and a biddable share from the revenue earned from incremental production over an agreed baseline.\u201dMumbai High is one of the prime assets of ONGC and significant upside is still to be unlocked here if ONGC applies best-in-class reservoir management technologies and adopts globally-best operational and management practices,\u201d the firm said, adding that the bids are due in mid-September. The identified service provider would carry out a comprehensive review of field performance and identify improvements in wells, reservoirs including water injection, and facilities management (WRFM).It would suggest and help implement suitable technological interventions to improve production. Integrated reservoir/FEED studies and development of detailed work plans for field development would also be within the scope of work, it said. \u201dAll international oil and gas majors, having annual revenue above USD 75 billion are invited to participate in this ICB.\u201d\n       ",

    "Norway\u2019s central bank has excluded Adani Group\u2019s port firm, APSEZ from its government pension fund over ethical concerns, making it the 15th Indian company to face such action with previous ones being the likes of ONGC, GAIL, NTPC and Vedanta. Norges Bank, which manages the sovereign wealth fund, on May 15 stated that it has decided to exclude Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone due to \u201dunacceptable risk that the company contributes to serious violations of individuals\u2019 rights in situations of war or conflict.\u201dAPSEZ, which was on the central bank\u2019s watch list for possible exclusion from investment since March 2022, faced the action due to its business association with the armed forces in Myanmar. Sources however said the Adani group firm sold the Myanmar asset entirely in May last year, and there has been no incremental disclosures made regarding that asset, as the company has fully exited.The Norwegian fund\u2019s Council of Ethics acknowledged APSEZ\u2019s May 2023 disclosure that it had sold its port-related operations in Myanmar to Solar Energy Ltd but said \u201dno information on buyer is available, and APSEZ has stated that it cannot share any such information on the grounds of confidentiality.\u201d\u201dLack of information means that the Council cannot establish whether APSEZ has links to the enterprise concerned. In a situation in which extremely serious norm violations are taking place, this constitutes an unacceptable risk that the Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global\u2019s (GPFG\u2019s) investments in APSEZ may breach its ethical guidelines,\u201d it added.The Norwegian Fund started buying into APSEZ in mid-October, post the May 2023 disclosure. It made near 70 per cent on its first purchase in nearly 6 months, until it exited in April. APSEZ joins more than a dozen Indian firms which had faced similar action over the past few years, according to information on the website of Norges Bank Investment Management.The Norwegian bank had excluded ITC in January 2020 over production of tobacco. Similar action followed against Zuari Agro Chemicals in October 2013 over alleged human rights violations. Vedanta faced similar action in January 2014 over \u2019severe environmental damage\u2019.Coal India, NTPC, Reliance Power, Tata Power and three other power producers faced a similar action in April 2016 for production of coal or coal-based energy. BHEL faced action in May 2017 and January 2023 over environmental damage and sales to states in armed conflicts.Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) was charged with serious violations of individuals\u2019 rights in situations of war or conflict when it faced similar action in September 2021. GAIL was charged with the same in April 2023.\n       ",
    "The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) is likely to report a fall in net profit for the quarter ended March 2024 as analysts expect limited net realisation from oil and gas, and flattish sales volume. The company will report its Q4FY24 earnings on May 20.The upstream oil company's net profit is seen falling over 11 percent year-on-year to Rs 8,434 crore, according to the average of 8 analysts estimates surveyed by Moneycontrol. The decline in profit after tax (PAT) is expected to be on account of lower oil and gas production and a lower administered price mechanism for gas.The company's Q4 revenue is expected to decline marginally by 1.11 percent to Rs 34,404 crore. Meanwhile, EBITDA is seen falling half a percent YoY to Rs 17,251 crore on lower administered price mechanism (APM) gas price and lower oil and gas production by ONGC but partially offset by higher crude oil realisation.Sales volume estimatesMotilal Oswal expects oil realization (before windfall tax) to expand 5 percent YoY for ONGC, in line with Brent movement in Q4FY24. Oil sales volumes are seen rising 4 percent on-year, but gas sales volumes are expected to decline 2 percent YoY. The sales of Value Added Products (VAP) are also seen declining 4 percent YoY.Follow our market blog to catch all the live actionWrite-offs, survey expenses to hit PATWith both oil and gas prices capped and volumes largely flat, Kotak Institutional Equities expects a modest 3-5 percent QoQ EBITDA growth for upstream firms like ONGC, led by lower operating expenses (Opex).The PSU\u2019s PAT is likely to decline 14 percent on a sequential basis as well due to likely higher write-offs, and survey expenses in the fiscal fourth quarter, the brokerage said.Oil and Gas realisations estimatesJM Financial expects ONGC\u2019s Q4FY24 net crude and gas realisation to be largely flattish sequentially. Sales volume is also expected to be flat to slightly lower on a quarter-on-quarter (QoQ) basis.ONGC\u2019s net crude realisation adjusted for windfall tax will continue to be capped at $72-73 per barrel with a tad lower gross crude realisation being offset by a slight cut in windfall tax, the brokerage said.ONGC\u2019s gas realisations are also expected to be steady QoQ with domestic APM gas realisation being capped at $6.5 per metric million British thermal unit (MMBtu).\"Hence, ONGC\u2019s Q4FY24 EBITDA is expected to be up 1.5 percent sequentially QoQ as we expect overall crude sales volume to be largely flattish QoQ while gas sales volume could go up 1.5 prcent QoQ,\" said JM Financial in its preview.Margins, key monitorablesNomura expects Q4 margins to be at 50 percent, while Elara Capital expects margins to be at 48 percent. According to analysts at Motilal Oswal, an update on the ramp-up of gas production will be the key monitorable in the earnings report and post-result management commentary.Also Read |\u00a0JSW Steel stock gains; reports 64.5% YoY decline in net profitONGC stocks triggerAccording to Motilal Oswal, the potential operational and financial turnaround at ONGC Videsh Ltd (OVL) can be a major share price catalyst for ONGC.\"If ONGC manages to turn around ONGC Petro additions Ltd (OPaL), we believe this can add 5-8 percent to the current market price,\" the brokerage said. A delay in peak oil production from KG Basin or decline in oil prices below $75 per barrel are key downside risks, it added.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "Shares of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) gained on April 18 as Morgan Stanley has issued an 'overweight' call on the PSU stock with a target of Rs 304 per share. The brokerage expects the upstream oil company's outperformance to continue, bolstered by improved capital allocation strategies.Additionally, stable regulations are anticipated to support a steady 18-20 percent return on equity (RoE).ONGC's slow ramp-up in domestic production by the end of 2024 has been well communicated, adding to the positive outlook for the company, Morgan Stanley said.The ONGC stock has gained over 5 percent in the last five trading sessions due to a surge in crude oil prices amid rising hostilities between Israel and Iran. The Brent crude prices have been hovering near $90 a barrel and are trading much higher than levels of $75-80 a barrel seen in February this year.Follow our market blog to catch all the live actionAccording to analysts, the upstream oil and gas producers as ONGC should benefit from higher crude prices.Jefferies also recently initiated coverage on ONGC with a 'buy' rating, driven by favourable crude and gas reforms as well as improved profitability. The brokerage has set a target price of Rs 390 apiece, implying a potential upside of 37 percent from the previous close. The foreign brokerage also expects strong free-cash-flow (FCF) generation and net-debt reduction for the company.Why Jefferies is bullish on ONGCAccording to Jefferies analysts, ONGC stands to gain from a tight crude oil market, as the IEA (International Energy Agency). The government's pragmatism has also allowed it to increase ONGC net realization to $75 even in the face of industry under-recoveries.Also, Special Additional Excise Duty (SAED) or windfall tax will not apply to new KG-basin output, allowing for greater participation in the rise in oil prices.Reforms to gas pricing\u00a0are expected to add to earnings for ONGC, Jefferies added.\u00a0Despite the higher operating expenses, analysts believe that KG basin production would be profitable, allaying a major investor concern. As a result of price reforms, net realization per barrel of oil equivalent (boe) increased.Also Read |\u00a0Buzzing Stocks: Adani Ent, Infosys, Tata Comm, Vodafone Idea, HDFC Bank, Ambuja Cement, Paytm, Zee and othersAnalysts at Jefferies anticipate the trend to continue through FY24\u201326 estimated.
