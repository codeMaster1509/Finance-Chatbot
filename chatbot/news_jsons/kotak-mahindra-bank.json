    "Private sector lender Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) plans to focus on brick-and-mortar business strategies and aims to open 170-200 branches in 2024-25, the bank\u2019s group president and head of consumer banking Virat Diwanji said.The bank, which recently faced regulatory actions from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), plans to focus\u00a0on its existing customers. The central bank in April\u00a0issued a\u00a0cease-and-desist order under Section 35A of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, after weaknesses were detected in its operational risk management. The regulator prevented the bank from\u00a0enlisting new customers through online and mobile banking channels and from issuing fresh credit cards.The unsecured loans business, on which the bank has set an annual growth target of around 15-16 percent, is a section where the bank will continue to focus and target existing customers, Diwanji said. Edited excerpts from the interaction:Also read:\u00a0RBI curbs on Kotak Mahindra Bank to hurt retail business, stock may fall up to 5%, says expertHow is Kotak Mahindra Bank looking at growing its retail and unsecured business after the RBI restrictions?The RBI restrictions are on digital acquisition of new customers and fresh issuance of credit cards. On the account opening side, we always had two streams, one being digital and the other through our frontline staff in branches through direct contact of potential customers using biometric verification. While we may not be able to cover the entire shortfall on account of digital acquisition, we are trying to improve productivity of our frontline branch staff through data analytics, providing better quality leads to our ground team.The loss of book growth in value terms for credit cards would be real. However, we will focus on our huge customer base through advanced analytics to prequalify customers for personal loans and business loans.With restrictions in place\u00a0on your bank\u2019s digital business, how and what will be the focus to grow CASA (current account and savings account) deposits? What are the new things that the bank is looking at?We are taking multiple steps to improve CASA deposits. First, we are focusing on increasing both the number and quality of customers acquired through our physical channel teams. Second, we are enhancing customer service and engagement to ensure customers do not move their money out of the bank. Third, we have relationship managers engaging with customers to make Kotak Bank their primary account. This includes encouraging customers to subscribe to services like SIPs (systematic investment plans), utility bill payments, and EMI (equated monthly instalment) payments through their Kotak account.We have relaunched our ad campaign for Active Money which had given us good upside on CASA in addition to deposits. These measures aim to increase customer engagement and retention, thus improving CASA deposits.What would be your ideal growth target for the unsecured loans business in FY25?We have always maintained that our unsecured portfolio would be around the mid-teens of our overall asset book. We will aim to still pursue this target. In the recent past our credit cards business has been growing fast and we already have a strong base. Our focus is on offering immense value to our customers by enhancing customer engagement through multiple propositions, loyalty programmes and, thereby, increasing the overall spends on the cards.How is your bank looking at branch expansion? Will we see more of\u00a0it in FY25 compared to FY24?As we know, 95 percent to 96 percent of savings account customers transact outside the branch, either on mobile or on net banking and, hence, the expansion has been focused on the area where essentially there is a business community.Infra development and urbanisation coupled with increasing prosperity in rural India are opening up new opportunities. For branch expansion, we\u2019re figuring out the pockets where we are under-penetrated and where the availability of liabilities is easy. We have been adding roughly 150-odd branches for several years now. This year too, the momentum is going to continue. We are looking to add about 175\u2013200 branches this financial year.Also read:\u00a0'Robbing Peter to pay Paul': Uday Kotak makes veiled remarks on Vodafone Idea\u2019s share sale to Nokia, EricssonOn the retail side, which subsegments are working well for your bank and what are some trends that you\u2019ve seen in the businesses in the past few months?Our other businesses such as the mortgage\u2014which includes home loans\u00a0and loans against property\u2014and business banking segments are doing very well. Our mortgage book crossed the Rs 1 lakh crore milestone in the quarter ended March 31, 2024. In general, with rapid infra development such as highways and airports across the country, urbanisation and industrial clusters coming up, there\u2019s good momentum in the economy and we are capitalising on it. The focus on the SME (small and medium enterprise) sector is also yielding positive results on lending book growth.Our mortgage lending business, which is both a home loan and LAP on the consumer side, continues to grow well with a\u00a0year-on-year growth of 15 percent, as we saw in Q4. This momentum is continuing as the economic environment is stable and there is buoyancy in the market. The performance of the portfolio continues to be extremely robust, reflecting strong credit quality.How is business banking working for Kotak?We have seen robust demand and have grown over 25 percent on a\u00a0year-on-year basis in Q4. Our portfolio quality is extremely good and we expect to continue the pace of growth. We are encouraged by the demand coming from the tier 2 and 3 cities, where we have made investments in terms of manpower and technology to tap this potential. We are also using analytics to predict customer requirements as well as to smoothen transactions for them, like auto renewal, pre-approved limits. Customers in this segment are highly engaged and consume more products of the bank compared to other asset products. We are designing products focused on specific segments like healthcare\u00a0and renewable energy which we feel will grow tremendously in the next few years.\n       ",
    "Kotak Mahindra Bank led among the Nifty 50 stocks with the highest number of brokerage upgrades in May, due to its attractive valuations and a decrease in gross non-performing assets (NPAs).According to Moneycontrol's Analyst Call Tracker, 'buy' recommendations for Kotak Mahindra Bank increased to 28 in May, up from 23 in April. 'Hold' calls decreased to 10 from 14, and 'sell' recommendations dropped to five from seven the previous month.JP Morgan upgraded its rating to 'overweight,' citing the bank's \"very cheap\" valuation. \"Kotak Mahindra Bank has reasonable flexibility on operational expenses to mitigate any margin pressures. After consistent EPS upgrades over the last year and following the de-rating, we think valuations are inexpensive at 10x FY26 earnings,\" the brokerage stated.JP Morgan also projected that Kotak Mahindra Bank's balance sheet would grow by 16 percent annually over the next two years, with earnings expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16-17 percent during the same period.Ajit Kumar Kabi, a research analyst at LKP Securities, noted a significant reduction in the bank's gross NPA ratio due to slower slippages and improved recoveries. The gross NPA stood at 1.39 percent, down from 1.78 percent a year earlier, while the net NPA ratio remained stable at 0.34 percent, compared to 0.37 percent at the end of FY23.RBI action noted, but impact considered limitedThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) imposed restrictions on Kotak Mahindra Bank on April 24, prohibiting new customer acquisitions through its online and mobile banking channels and halting the issuance of new credit cards, citing significant compliance failures in its technology platforms.During its Q4 FY24 results conference call, the bank stated that the RBI's measures would likely impact profit before tax by about 2-3 percent, equating to a financial effect in the range of Rs 300-450 crores on an annualised basis. The bank also plans to enhance its relationships with existing customers to mitigate the impact on its operations.Although the restrictions could affect the growth of new credit cards and customer acquisition, the bank intends to increase investment in technology to resolve the issues, according to JP Morgan.BOB Capital maintained a 'buy' rating on the stock, noting in a May 7 report, \"The recent regulatory restrictions on new credit card issuance and digital onboarding of new clients may slow growth momentum and margins, and the overall return ratio. However, the recent price correction has already factored in most of the negatives.\"Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "A weaker majority for the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led alliance may increase welfare spending but not result in additional borrowing, limiting a rise in bond yields, a top executive at India's Kotak Mahindra Bank said.Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party failed to get an outright majority in the recently concluded parliamentary elections, making them dependent on support from regional parties to form a government.That raised concerns that the new government will take populist measures, which will increase spending and could, in turn, see additional borrowing pressure.\"I do not expect the government to raise gross borrowing for the current financial year in the final budget as they have received an unexpectedly large amount as dividend from the Reserve Bank of India,\" said Rajeev Mohan, president of treasury and global markets at Kotak Mahindra Bank, the country's fourth largest private lender in terms of assets.The Indian government will table the final budget for this year before end of July.Last month, the RBI transferred a record surplus of 2.11 trillion rupees to the central government, more than double of expectations. That money \"can be easily used for any welfare schemes that they may undertake,\" Mohan said in an interview late Thursday.India's gross borrowing is aimed at 14.13 trillion rupees ($169.32 billion) in the current financial year, aiming to contain fiscal deficit at 5.1%.Mohan also ruled out any possibilities of a supply cut, as speculated by some sections of the market.At best, the government could \"cancel auctions occasionally if the yield that the market demands is higher than their expectations,\" he said.On Tuesday, the 10-year benchmark bond yield shot above the 7% mark and witnessed its biggest single session rise in eight months, as voting trends and counts turned out to be sharply different from exit poll predictions of a thumping BJP majority.Mohan said demand from banks as well as long-term investors will continue to support the benchmark and the 10-year yield may not rise above 7.10% mark over the next six months.He also said he prefers longer duration bonds due to higher demand and lower supply, expecting yields to decline long-term, while visibility on liquidity remains low.\"On the downside, I do not see the 10-year yield crossing the 6.90% mark till we see the RBI delivering a cut in repo rate. Our base case for an interest rate cut is December, as inflation is expected to reach closer to the 4% target by then,\" Mohan said.\n       ",
    "LKP Research's research report on Kotak Mahindra BankKotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) has shown a decline in performance over the last three years (3Y return: -7.4%, 1Y return: -13.3%) compared to the returns of Bank Nifty (3Y return: 37.4%, 1Y return: 11.5%) and Nifty (3Y return: 43.6%, 1Y return: 21.6%). This underperformance can be attributed to several factors, including the stepping down of Mr. Uday Kotak, slower business growth relative to Kotak\u2019s usual standards, and supervisory actions by the RBI. However, the bank has maintained strong asset quality during this period. Looking ahead to FY25, there are indications of a revival, particularly evident in robust deposit growth, which is expected to bolster business expansion given the comfortable Capital to Deposit Ratio (CDR) level at 84%. We anticipate that margins will remain steady in the near term, supported by favourable credit costs. Our estimate for FY26E Return on Equity (ROE) stands at 18.5%, up from the current level of 15.5%, driven by a projected credit growth of 18% CAGR for FY24-26E. Furthermore, the Bank\u2019s valuation is currently at 3(x) trailing Price-to-Book Value per Share (P/BVPS), compared to the 5-Year median P/BVPS of 4.1(x).OutlookWe believe that there is a strong likelihood of the stock undergoing rerating due to improving return ratios.

    "The rising expenditure on the information and technology (IT) and digital services of Kotak Mahindra Bank in the financial years (FY) 2022 and 2023, (the two years over which\u00a0the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) expressed\u00a0significant concerns in\u00a0the bank\u2019s IT management), was accompanied by a jump in customer complaints in the internet banking, mobile banking and e-banking segments, data from the bank\u2019s annual reports and management commentary showed.In the two years, the bank increased its expenditure on IT and digital services by an average of 43 percent.According to the commentary from the bank management, the expenditure on IT stood at around 7-10 percent of the total expenditure in FY22 and FY23. For instance, in FY 22, the IT expenses of the bank stood around Rs 834 crore. \u201cThe operating tech cost as part of the overall tech cost is about 7.5 percent and that\u2019s been consistent through this year. Both for the quarter and the year, and of course, if I add the CAPEX, it would be another one-third of that addition to that,\u201d said Jaimin Bhatt, then Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Kotak Mahindra Bank.\u201cIf I look at it, at the bank level, our total expenditure for FY24 is about Rs 16,780 crore which was up from Rs 13,800 crore in FY23.

The actions followed an RBI examination of the bank's IT systems over the last two years and the bank\u2019s continued failure to address concerns.\"These actions are necessitated based on significant concerns arising out of the Reserve Bank\u2019s IT Examination of the bank for the years 2022 and 2023 and the continued failure on the part of the bank to address these concerns in a comprehensive and timely manner,\" RBI said.Combating IT issuesPost RBI\u2019s hammer, the bank, in its investor presentation for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, announced proactive measures aimed at mitigating potential business impacts. The bank conveyed its intention to strategically redeploy resources to counteract the ramifications of the central bank's directives. \"The bank is looking to redeploy resources to minimise the business impact and believes that these directions will not materially impact its overall business,\" the bank said in the investor presentation.The bank estimates an impact of Rs 300-450 crore\u00a0profit-before-tax (PBT) in FY25 following the regulatory action. And the management said that it will step-up investments to fortify its IT systems by focusing on sustainable compliance to baseline cyber security framework for banks and strengthening digital payment security controls. The bank will also hire\u00a0an external auditor to assess the overall technology architecture soon, as mandated by the RBI.Acknowledging the regulatory restrictions imposed by the RBI, Kotak Mahindra Bank conducted a thorough assessment of their potential repercussions. Specifically, the bank identified potential challenges affecting new credit card issuance and customer acquisition through its 811 platform. \"Impact would be on franchise and customers, directly impacted businesses, primarily new credit cards and customer acquisition through 811, potential financial impact,\" the bank said.Solving the issues around banks\u2019s IT management is the number one priority for the bank, said Ashok Vaswani, Chief Executive Officer, Kotak Mahindra Bank. \u201cThis is the number one management priority for the bank and between Shanti (Shanti Ekambaram, whole time director), Devang and the management team, we are obviously spending much more time on the technology issues and we will continue to spend much time till we get this right,\u201d Vaswani said in a post results press conference on May 4.Also read:\u00a0RBI action poses challenge to Jay Kotak-led Kotak 811, say industry veteransDigital business of the bankThe bank\u2019s digital business is majorly sourced from Kotak811, its digital banking arm which is co-headed by Kotak Mahindra Bank\u2019s founder Uday Kotak\u2019s son Jay Kotak.

    "Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. plans to hire around 400 engineers this year as it races to upgrade its technology systems after coming under the regulator\u2019s scrutiny for lapses.The lender, backed by Indian billionaire Uday Kotak, has already brought on board more than 500 engineers from scratch over the last two years, according to Milind Nagnur, the bank\u2019s chief technology officer. It has pulled them from firms like Google and Amazon.com Inc. as well as from Paytm and PhonePe Pvt., Nagnur said in an interview.With the hires this year, the bank will have achieved a \u201ccritical mass\u201d in talent and additions would be gradual after that, he said. India\u2019s fourth largest private lender boosted spending on technology by more than 30% to 17 billion rupees ($204 million) in the year ended March 31, making up about 10% of operating expenses, according to Kotak\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Ashok Vaswani at a press briefing over the weekend.The team will be seeking to overcome a ban imposed last month by the Reserve Bank of India on adding new customers through its digital channels and issuing fresh credit cards. Kotak\u2019s governance and risk management in its technology systems are in the spotlight as the regulator had singled those out as among the reasons behind its action.\u201cWe are going to just double up, put far more efforts, far more resources, far more money into moving this thing as fast as possible,\u201d Vaswani said. The spending is expected to rise as the bank deepens its technology build-out, he said.Nagnur was among Kotak\u2019s most high-profile technology hires, alongside Bhavnish Lathia, its chief of customer experience, both of whom joined in 2022. Nagnur previously worked at the US-based fintech company Early Warning Services LLC, while Lathia spent nearly two decades at Amazon.\u201cWe do worry about everything that you see and hear,\u201d said Nagnur in comments before the RBI ban. \u201cWe have to worry about cyber risk, we have to worry about operational risk, human errors in sending payments to the wrong person, or geographic risk, credit and debit card frauds.\u201dThe bank is using artificial intelligence in areas like fraud risk management, rewriting customer chat bots for better service and for sentiment analysis on the bank, leading to faster resolution of problems, said Nagnur, who recently expanded his role to also become chief operating officer.About 98% of the transaction volume in Kotak\u2019s savings accounts were by digital or non-branch methods, according to its most recent investor presentation for the third quarter. The bank sold 95% of new personal loans by volume and 99% of new credit cards digitally in the same period, highlighting the challenges of maintaining this growth pace with the RBI ban.The regulator said it found deficiencies and non-compliance in Kotak\u2019s various processes over two years \u2014 from a lack of data security and leak prevention strategies to vendor risk management. It said it had engaged with the bank but \u201cthe outcomes have been far from satisfactory.\u201dRead More: Kotak Bank to Focus on Cross-Selling Products Till RBI Ban Lifts\u201cWhat really is changing is the backend where we are going deep into resiliency, uptime, cybersecurity,\u201d said Nagnur. \u201cWhile the digital transaction volumes are exponentially growing, you have to be substantially ready in the backend to handle these type of volumes.\u201d\n       ",

    "Emkay Global Financial's research report on Kotak Mahindra BankKotak Mahindra Bank (Kotak) reported a huge 28% beat on PAT (which stood at Rs41bn), mainly on treasury gains/debt syndication fees, reversal of AIF provisions (Rs1.6bn), and lower tax rate @21%. Its CASA ratio has slipped by 1,500bps in the last 2Y to 45.5%; this, coupled with the recent RBI embargo on digital customer sourcing (incl. Kotak 811) and slower branch expansion vs peers, could further hurt the bank amid the raging war for retail deposits. Also, ban on new card sourcing will hurt mkt share/revenue, more so in the medium term, as seen in HDFCB. Mgmt guides to PBT impact of Rs3-4.5bn (3% of FY25E PBT) due to the RBI embargo, but we believe impact on the business/financials would be far more widespread, unless resolved soon. Thus, we cut FY25E-27E growth by 200bps and expect the RoA/RoE trajectory to slip to 1.9-2.3%/13- 14%, on higher opex/provisions. Higher attrition (incl. in KMP) and Bank\u2019s strategy to reduce provision buffers vs peers amid rising asset-quality noise, adds to our concerns.OutlookWe retain REDUCE with TP cut to Rs1,625/sh (Rs1,750 earlier), valuing the SA bank at 1.8x FY26E ABV and subsidiary at Rs525/sh.For all recommendations report,\u00a0click hereDisclaimer:\u00a0The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

    "The RBI crackdown\u00a0on Kotak Mahindra Bank last week didn't come as a bolt from the blue. The action didn't really surprise the insiders too.The regulator had conducted IT checks on the bank in 2022 and again in 2023 before issuing corrective action plans.\u00a0Going by the statement issued by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the continued failure on part of the private sector lender to address the concerns raised by the watchdog in a comprehensive and timely manner had resulted in the action last week.Put it simply, the central bank waited for two years before cracking the whip, because the bank failed to comply with the guidelines. For the new chief executive of Kotak Mahindra Bank, the RBI action has come as the first big challenge since he took over following the exit of bank's founder Uday Kotak from an executive role.Even in the case of HDFC Bank back in December 2020, the RBI action had barely triggered frowns. There were frequent engagements between theregulator and the bank in the one-and-a-half years preceding the RBI action when the lender had reported frequent digital outages causing inconvenience to customers. This too was a major challenge for then a new-comer,\u00a0Sashidhar Jagdishan, who had just taken the baton from Aditya Puri. In HDFC Bank, too, the issue was inaction or inadequate action by the private lender during the Puri days in addressing its perpetual tech issues.Yet another case\u2014though not directly comparable with KMB and HDFC Bank\u2014is the RBI action on Paytm Payments Bank Ltd (PPBL) early this year. Among the problems cited by the RBI, one of the issues was inadequate compliance in the way the bank carried out the functions of the Paytm App and drawing a line between the parent and the bank in terms of operations.PPBL\u2019s dependence on the IT infrastructure of OCL remained absolute and there was no operational segregation. Many transactions were routed through the parent entity-owned apps, raising serious concerns on data privacy and data sharing, the RBI found during its inspections. In Paytm case, too, the RBI had been talking to PPBL for two-and-a-half years about the non-compliance but the company didn't take any action.In all three cases of RBI crackdown on Kotak Mahindra Bank, HDFC Bank and Paytm Payments Bank, one factor stands common\u00a0-\u00a0the regulator gave sufficient time each of the entities to rectify the tech-related issues, but all of them had shrugged off the warnings.But why are the banks failing to get their tech game right, again and again?The fact is while the banks went on an overdrive to launch digital products, they did not invest enough to firm up and upgrade\u00a0their technology platforms. The RBI has taken the lapses seriously. Technology has helped banking services evolve to the tech-age, but for the banking services to become more inclusive, the lenders need to make sure the alternative channels work seamlessly. Considering the significant growth in number and value of digital transactions over the last few years, they need\u00a0to invest in technology.The advancement in technology, the rise in digital payment apps, and the\u00a0ease of digital banking\u00a0have\u00a0sent\u00a0online transactions zooming across the country. Just to understand it better, transactions through the unified payments interface (UPI) platform crossed 100 billion in 2023 alone to close at 118 billion, shows data shared by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). This marks a 60 percent growth from 74 billion UPI transactions recorded a year back.Also, most banks have significantly shifted their business acquisitions through digital channels. In case of Kotak Bank, as per latest data, Kotak 811 has emerged as a a critical division in its operations, accounting for nearly 95\u00a0percent personal loan disbursals, 99\u00a0percent credit card sales, and 79\u00a0percent new businesses.But, while the banks relied increasingly on digital channels, they did not upgrade their systems to handle such spiralling business volumes, which\u00a0inexorably paved way for a spurt in glitches.\u00a0The banks downplayed the technical glitches as routine occurrences, but the RBI refused to buy the argument. The regulator kept on reiterating that the\u00a0banks need to scale up investment in strengthening the technology before launching products to ensure their platforms could handle the volume without causing inconvenience to the customer.For some reason, the banks seem to have ignored the wake-up call from the RBI for long. Now, after the whip if cracked, it\u2019s high time for the banks to go for a course correction.Banking Central\u00a0is a weekly column that keeps a close watch and connects the dots about the sector's most important events for readers.

    "JP Morgan upgraded Kotak Mahindra Bank (KMB) to overweight from neutral, citing supportive valuations post recent RBI actions and senior management departure. The target price has been raised to Rs 2070 per share, marking a 34 percent increase from the last close.JP Morgan stated that the impact after RBI action on F25/26 growth should be minimal. In Q4, the bank demonstrated strong core operating metrics, with headline profit adjusted for one-offs surpassing JPMe by 8 percent. Core PPOP growth stood at +% 12y/y, accompanied by significant fee growth.Kotak Mahindra Bank estimated the total impact of the RBI ban at a minimal Rs 300-500 crore at the PBT level (2 percent of F26 PBT at the top end). During the analyst call, KMB expressed confidence in sustaining growth faster than the system, aiming for 1.5-2x nominal GDP, with F25 advances growth at -20 percent. Asset quality remains strong, and despite NIMs decreasing throughout the year, ROAs have remained steady. The new CEO prioritized strengthening core technology and resilience. Notably, KMB's tech spending at 10 percent of opex compares favorably with large peers, although the absolute numbers may be lower due to scale.\"We believe KMB can continue to compound balance sheet at 16% CAGR over next 2 years and even factoring ROA normalization down (from F24 2.6%) we think bank earnings can compound at 16-17% CAGR over next 2 years with scope for upside driven by better opex control. Valuations at 10x F26E parent P/E are compelling for what is a high quality and growth compounding franchise\", JP Morgan said in its note.JP Morgan raised F25/26E EPS of Kotak Bank, considering improved ROAs (F25/26 at 2.47/2.5% vs. earlier <2.3%). KMB shows flexibility in opex to offset margin pressures. With consistent EPS upgrades over the past year, valuations appear cheap at 10x F26E parent bank P/E. On consolidated earnings, the stock's F25/26E P/E ratios look favorable at 15x/12x for a 16% EPS CAGR, it said.Kotak Mahindra Bank faced pressure in recent sessions due to the RBI's ban on new customer onboarding through online and mobile banking, along with the suspension of issuing new credit cards.
