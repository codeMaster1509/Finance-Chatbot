    "By Kunal Shah, senior technical & derivative analyst at LKP SecuritiesPrior to the FOMC meeting, the Nifty50 faced selling pressure from higher levels but successfully held the 18,940 support levels. The immediate resistance on the upside is identified at 19,100, and a breakout above this level may trigger short-covering moves toward the 19,250-19,300 range.Conversely, if the lower-end support at 18,940 is breached on a closing basis, it could intensify selling pressure, potentially pushing the index to new lows.The Bank Nifty index formed a Doji candlestick pattern, suggesting a state of indecision at the current levels, with a battle between bulls and bears. Immediate resistance is observed at 43,000, where significant open interest is concentrated on the Call side. A breach above this level could trigger short-covering moves towards 43,500.Conversely, the lower-end support is positioned at 42,400, and if it is breached on a closing basis, it may escalate the selling pressure.Here are three buy calls for short term:Karur Vysya Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 148 | Stop-Loss: Rs 142 | Target: Rs 154-158 | Return: 7 percentKarur Vysya Bank is currently displaying some promising signals\u00a0as the stock appears to be on the verge of a breakout.

    "1. Second quarter GDP growth likely to surprise on upside, says RBI governorEconomic growth in the fiscal second quarter is likely to surprise on the upside, Reserve Bank of India governor Shaktikanta Das has said. The central bank has projected a GDP growth rate of 6.5 percent for the three months to September, while growth for 2023-24 is seen at 6.5 percent. Evolving geopolitics pose a challenge globally, affecting financial markets and global growth, Das said.Why it\u2019s important: The upside could be due to robust early indicators and the sustained momentum in economic activities. India seems to be well placed to mitigate geopolitical risks to a large extent.2. Core infrastructure sectors grow at 8.1 percent, fiscal deficit at 39 percent of targetOutput of eight core infra sectors, which accounts for two-fifths of the country\u2019s industrial output, grew at a healthy 8.1 percent in September, official data showed. At the same time, the central government\u2019s fiscal deficit during the April-September period stood at Rs 7.02 lakh crore, or 39% of the full-year estimate of Rs 17.87 lakh crore, data from the Controller General of Accounts showed.Why it\u2019s important: Despite the healthy number, core sector output expanded at its slowest pace in four months. The fiscal deficit has been contained by double-digit growth in tax and non-tax revenue receipts.3. Government orders investigation after Apple sounds hacking alarm in iPhonesMultiple messages from Apple to iPhones of several opposition leaders and journalists, warning them that they could be potential targets of an unspecified state-sponsored privacy attack has raised a furor, prompting the central government to order a probe of the reported bids to hack into cellphones. Users facing such attacks are \u201cindividually targeted because of who they are or what they do,\u201d Apple\u2019s alert said.Why it\u2019s important: Although the government has questioned the non-specific nature of the alarm, the timing of the alleged privacy attack ahead of a crucial election season is bound to raise hackles. There was an earlier uproar over Pegasus spyware as well.4. Government to plug holes in legal framework to deter financial offendersThe central government is reviewing India\u2019s legal framework to identify gaps that financial offenders could exploit to launder money, with possible changes in rules and regulations expected over the next few weeks. The development comes when the country is undergoing a peer review by the Financial Action Task Force, a United Nations body.Why it\u2019s important: India would like to ensure that its legal system withstands the scrutiny of the task force and complies with global standards to stop money laundering and terror financing.5. Imported electric vehicles worth up to $35,000 may see significantly slashed leviesIndia is considering lower import duties for electric vehicles up to a certain price level. All completely built-up vehicles priced below $40,000 now face an import duty of 70 percent, and a new national policy may slash it to 15-30 percent for electric vehicles priced up to $25,000-35,000.Why it\u2019s important: The development would provide an opportunity for foreign electric vehicle makers such as Tesla to gain a foothold in the rapidly expanding Indian market, where appetite for premium personal vehicles have been on a high for quite some time.6. Larsen & Toubro reports 45 percent growth in net profit on better order executionLarsen & Toubro reported 45 percent growth in consolidated net profit to Rs 3,223 crore in the September quarter. The construction and engineering giant reported an operating revenue of Rs 51,024 crore in three months, up 19 percent from a year ago. The company received orders worth Rs 89,153 crore in the quarter, registering a robust growth of 72 percent compared with a year ago.Why it\u2019s important: The expansion in L&T\u2019s order book indicates strong momentum in the infrastructure sector despite five assembly polls and parliamentary elections next year.7. License fee ruling erodes Bharti Airtel\u2019s second quarter profit by 38 percentBharti Airtel posted a 38 percent fall in net profit from over a year ago to Rs 1,341 crore in the fiscal second quarter because of a one-time tax and interest provisioning of Rs 1,619 crore that followed a ruling by the Supreme Court that telecom companies could not treat license fee as an expense. The telco posted revenue of Rs 37,044 crore, up 7.3 percent from a year earlier.Why it\u2019s important: Despite the one-time provisioning, the numbers at airtel are quite healthy as it showed consistent performance in its India operations. It added a record 1 million postpaid customers in the quarter.8. Indian Oil swings back to profit in September quarter, beating analysts\u2019 expectationsState-run Indian Oil Corporation saw a remarkable turnaround as consolidated net profit soared to Rs 13,713 crore, bouncing back from a loss of Rs 910 crore in year-ago three months. However, on a sequential basis, net profit showed a 7 percent decrease from Rs 14,735 crore recorded in the March quarter.Why it\u2019s important: The state-owned oil marketer saw a significant rise in consolidated annual net profit despite marketing margins for auto fuels crashing amid rising costs of crude oil.9. Central ministerial group likely to oversee online gaming regulationThe Union government is likely to set up a group of ministers to look into the regulatory framework for the gaming industry and consider other issues impacting the sector. The panel will likely include home minister Amit Shah, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw and information and broadcasting minister Anurag Thakur as members.Why it\u2019s important: India has been cracking down hard on online gaming. The industry is scrambling to set up a self-regulating body but that would not deter the authorities to tighten rules further.10. Number of eateries to see spurt in metros as well as smaller cities on higher demandA record number of new restaurants, pubs, bars, and cloud kitchens will be opening their doors in the December quarter across metropolises as well as smaller cities and towns for the New Year. Food delivery platforms are also seeing a surge in new restaurant partners.Why it\u2019s important: Restaurateurs are looking to capitalize on the higher demand they have been seeing since the pandemic. An increasing number of Indians are eating out or ordering takeaways.\u00a0\n       ",
    "Indian Oil Corporation on October 31 reported its fiscal second quarter net profit at Rs 12,967 crore, swinging into green from a net loss of Rs 272 crore a year ago.India\u2019s largest PSU oil refining and marketing company\u2019s Q2 FY24 net profit was driven by lower crude oil input costs and inventory gains, the results showed. The company\u2019s net profit beat analysts\u2019 estimate of Rs 9,640 crore.Indian Oil\u2019s revenue from operations for the July-September quarter fell 11 percent to Rs 2.o3 lakh crore, from Rs 2.31 lakh crore in the same quarter previous year, according to an exchange filing. The state-run company was expected to report revenue of Rs 2,34,780 crore, up 13 percent from a year earlier, according to a Moneycontrol poll of five brokerages.The company\u2019s average gross refining margin (GRM) for the fiscal first half April-September 2023 was $13.12 per barrel. This compared with $25.49 per barrel in the year-ago period.IOCL shares gained o.4 percent to Rs 88.20 during the afternoon trade after the results were announced.Discounted Russian crude aid marginsIndian Oil's refining companies benefited from discounted Russian crude and significant inventory gains, offsetting the impact of unchanged retail prices of petrol and diesel. In April 2022, companies including Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum paused increasing prices of diesel and petrol after crude skyrocketed in the aftermath of the Russia-Ukraine war. Later, oil prices stabilised, boosting refining margins.Revenue from petroleum products for the quarter fell 12 percent Y-O-Y while profit before tax was at Rs 17,169.9 crore, against a loss of Rs244.23 crore a year earlier.However, concerns of higher crude costs are looming once again. Earlier this month, analysts said oil refining companies are expected to report a decline in marketing margins in the second quarter of FY24 due to high crude oil prices. Additionally, dwindling Russian crude discounts also pose a risk.Future imports from Venezuela?India may resume purchases of crude oil from Venezuela. In October, the US eased oil, trade, and financial sanctions on Venezuela. India was a regular buyer of Venezuelan crude oil grades prior to the imposition of US sanctions, according to an S&P Global report from October 24.\"One of the driving factors that led Indian refiners to opt for these long-distance Venezuelan crude grades during those years was the discounted pricing offered by the Venezuelan producers,\" said Sumit Ritolia, refinery economics analyst at S&P Global. \"Indian refiners are likely to consider the Venezuelan market to import discounted barrels.\"\n       ",
    "Indian Oil Corporation, the nation\u2019s biggest oil firm, will invest Rs 1,660.15 crore as equity in a newly set up joint venture with energy major NTPC Ltd for setting up renewable power plants.In June, IOC and NTPC had formed a 50:50 joint venture company, IndianOil NTPC Green Energy Pvt Ltd, to set up renewable energy projects to meet round-the-clock power requirements of refineries of the oil company. In a stock exchanging filing, IOC said its Board in a meeting on October 13, \u201dhas accorded approval to the investment plan of the joint venture company for setting up of renewable energy power plants and approved the equity contribution of up to Rs 1,660.15 crore towards Indian Oil\u2019s share of 50 per cent in the equity share capital of the JVC.\u201dOn June 2, IOC incorporated the joint venture company (JVC) with NTPC Green Energy Limited, (a wholly-owned subsidiary of NTPC Limited). \u201dIndianQil NTPC Green Energy Private Limited will develop renewable energy-based power projects (viz. solar PV, wind, any other renewable energy, energy storage or any combination of the same), to meet the round-the-clock (RTC) power requirements of new projects of IndianQOil Refineries,\u201d the firm had said at that time. The aim is to generate a minimum capacity of 650 MW of round-the-clock renewable power to fulfill the energy requirements of IOC refineries.NTPC, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, NGEL, has set an ambitious target of building a renewable generation portfolio of 60 GW over the next decade to aggressively pursue its green energy business. In March, IOC had announced a consolidation of its green assets under one umbrella for better synergy. It is aiming to build a portfolio of 3 GW of renewable energy and 0.6 million tonnes of biofuels by 2025. The renewable energy portfolio is to be expanded to 35 GW by 2030, and 200 GW by 2050.Alongside, it plans to raise the capacity to produce biofuels from agri and municipal waste to 7 million tonnes and biogas to 9 million tonnes by 2050. Its renewable energy portfolio currently stands at 239 MW, which is being expanded through new wind, solar, hydel and pumped hydro projects. It is collaborating with NTPC to augment its renewable energy capacity by around 2.8 GW. IOC is also solarising 20,705 petrol pumps with an installed capacity of 121 MW.Initiatives in EVs are being intensified by setting up 4,700 charging stations and 66 battery swapping stations. It has collaborated with Israeli start-up Phinergy for a battery joint venture. IOC has also firmly etched its presence in the nascent green hydrogen ecosystem of the country. The company has a firmed-up collaboration with ReNew Power Private Limited (ReNew) and Larsen & Toubro Limited (L&T) for green hydrogen business. A 7 kilo-tonnes per annum green hydrogen capacity is under development at the Panipat refinery.\n       ",
    "India's top fuel retailer Indian Oil Corporation will invest over Rs 4 lakh crore in this decade to expand oil refining and petrochemical business as well as in energy transition projects as part of a plan to become a '360-degree energy company', its chairman Shrikant Madhav Vaidya said on Friday.IndianOil will invest Rs 1 lakh crore in expanding capacity to refine and turn crude oil into fuel and a staggering Rs 2.4 lakh crore in projects that will help it achieve net-zero carbon emissions from its operations. Another Rs 60,000 crore is planned to be invested in setting up a giant petrochemical complex at Paradip in Odisha.These investments will help the company continue to meet the rising energy needs of a fast-expanding economy while also treading on the path of the energy transition, he told company shareholders at the annual general meeting.Vaidya said the past year witnessed waves of volatility that rocked the global energy dynamics but IOC kept its promise of fuelling the nation with unwavering commitment.\"As India's energy custodians, your company has crafted a clear roadmap to drive India's energy destiny,\" he told shareholders.\"To fuel the rising energy demand of an ascendant India, we are committed to increasing our share in India's energy pie from the current 9 per cent to around 1/8th or 12.5 per cent by 2050.\"For this, IOC is leveraging varied energy pathways that will establish it \"as a 360-degree energy company,\" he said. \"We are well-aligned with the need to ensure equitable energy access and sustainable transition.\" The firm which controls over 40 per cent of India's fuel market and is the largest oil refiner has set 2046 as the target date for net-zero carbon emissions.\"Our well-crafted blueprint, with a staggered investment plan of about Rs 2.4 lakh crore or USD 30 billion, will take us towards the net-zero destination,\" he said.These investments will be in producing green hydrogen to replace one currently used in refineries that come from fossil fuels, renewable energy capacity addition, biofuels, and carbon offsetting.Its energy transition plans also include an EV charging network and infrastructure to enable electric vehicles to swap chargeable batteries.While it navigates through the energy transition path, it is imperative that India strengthens its focus on the traditional fuel business, he said.\"The Indian economy is surging ahead, aiming for the USD 5 trillion-mark by 2025. Reflecting India's robust economic growth, the latest outlook from the International Energy Agency has pegged India's energy demand to go up from the current 5 million barrels per day (mbpd) to 7 mbpd by 2030, and about 9 mbpd by 2040,\" he said.Meeting this demand would require more investment in pumping crude oil from below ground or importing it from abroad, turning it into fuels like petrol and diesel at refineries, and taking them to nook-and-corner of the country through a well-oiled distribution network.And the tumultuous geopolitical events that unfolded last year led to the rearrangement of the energy baskets of the developed economies, leaning towards conventional fuels. \"Let me assure you that to ensure India's energy security, we are strengthening the traditional energy avenues, as we shape the green energy vision,\" he said.\"We are investing over Rs 1 lakh crore for expanding your company's refining capacity by about 33 per cent to reach almost 107 million tonnes per annum soon,\" he said.The expansion includes a new 9-million tonnes-per-annum oil refinery at Nagapattinam in Tamil Nadu.Alongside, it is pursuing petrochemical integration, which will help convert crude into chemicals that are building blocks for a variety of products ranging from plastics to paints and cosmetics.\"It can potentially offset business uncertainties and amplify the value of every hydrocarbon molecule,\" he said.IOC Board, he said, has accorded Stage-1 approval for the setting-up of Paradip petrochemical complex in Odisha at an estimated cost of over Rs 61,000 crore. This will be IOC's single largest investment at a location.The company is collaborating with Italy's Snam to explore the possibility of converting the existing natural gas pipelines for hydrogen transportation.Vaidya said the company continues to expand its retail network and has acquired sites to develop wayside amenities (WSA) on the Delhi-Mumbai expressway.Also, the firm is expanding its offering of branded fuels. \"Our 100 Octane petrol XP100 is now being offered at over 200 retail outlets, 95 Octane petrol XP95 is available at over 10,300 outlets, and the green diesel XtraGreen is being retailed at more than 5,600 outlets,\" he said.In LPG, it has launched a unique QR code-based 'Track N Trace' pilot initiative.IndianOil is developing a 10 kilo tonnes per annum green hydrogen plant at Panipat Refinery, he said, adding the company is also setting up a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (or SAF) plant of 86.8 thousand tonnes per annum capacity at Panipat.To support sustainable growth, the firm also plans to convert over 100 million PET bottles annually into uniforms for its on-ground teams, non-combat uniforms for the armed forces, and other stakeholders.\n       ",

    "India managed to reduce its overall expenditure on crude oil imports by taking advantage of discounted Russian oil. However, Indian Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) failed to maximise the benefits from this favorable situation. Kotak Institutional Equities in a report said that, \u201cWe also note that while India\u2019s overall crude imports costs have benefitted from Russian imports, OMCs\u2019 reported raw material costs do not show any increased advantage versus Dubai crude.\u201dKotak Institutional Equities say that the benefit of Russian crude will be higher for companies like Nayara Energy, which is owned by Rosneft, a Russian OMC. Indian oil companies have to spend more on transportation and insurance costs as compared to Nayara Energy which saves cost and benefits from the discounted Russian crude oil.Indian Oil Corporation\u2019s (IOC) raw material costs in Q2FY23 was around $115 per barrel, while Dubai crude oil was around $105 per barrel. This means IOC was not able to monetise the benefits of Russian imports.Similarly, Bharat Petroleum Corporation\u2019s (BPCL) raw material costs in Q2FY23 was around $115 per barrel compared\u00a0to Dubai crude oil, which was around $105 per barrel.Dubai crude is used as a benchmark. Thus, if Indian refiners\u2019 crude costs decline (versus Dubai crude), it not only boosts their refining GRMs, but also offers improved advantage over Singapore GRM.Also Read:\u00a0Oil India, ONGC gain as crude prices rally on Saudi plan to cut productionBetter Gross Refining Margins (GRM)Indian OMCs have reported strong GRMs as compared to the Singapore GRM complex margin. For FY23, IOC reported GRM of $19.5 per barrel, which was nearly two times of Singapore GRM complex margin of $10.8 per barrel. BPCL\u2019s GRM was $20.2 billion per barrel.IOC and BPCL have reported a strong GRM compared to large independent refiners like Reliance Industries Limited, Chennai Petroleum Corporation, and Mangalore Refineries and Petrochemical Limited. The report said, \u201dIn recent quarters, the gap with other refiners has increased as OMCs (surprisingly in our view) have not reported the GRM after the impact of windfall export taxes on retail fuels (diesel/petrol/ATF) that was implemented from July 1, 2022.\u201dAfter the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict, and sanctions on Russian crudes by several countries, India has emerged as a key buyer of Russian crude. From barely 1-2 percent of crude imports, share of Russian imports gradually increased in FY2023 to 21.5 percent. Russia is followed by Iraq (21.4 percent) and Saudi Arabia (16.7 percent), said the report.Analysts's viewsKotak Institutional Equities has put a sell rating on HPCL at a target price of Rs 257 and reduce the rating on IOCL and BPCL at Rs 89 and Rs 357 respectively. The institutional research firm will re-rate the Indian OMCs only if they continue their strong refining performance post the 2024 general elections, when OMCs will have greater control on the pump prices.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "Sharekhan's research report on Indian Oil CorporationQ4FY23 PAT of Rs. 10,059 crore (versus just Rs. 448 crore in Q3FY23) was significantly above our estimate due to a sharp beat in GRMs. Turnaround in the petchem segment, a forex gain of Rs. 989 crore and positive auto fuel marketing margin also contributed to strong earnings. GRM at $15.3/bbl was better than that of HPCL at $14/bbl and above our estimate of $11.5/bbl. Refining throughput/pipeline throughput/petchem sales volume at 19 mmt/25mmt/0.7mmt was up by 5%/6%/81% q-o-q. . We expect earnings to normalise over FY24-25 led by normalisation of crude oil prices. However, a spike in crude oil prices (from $74-75/bbl currently) is a key risk to earnings recovery especially given OMCs inability to hike petrol/diesel price given general election expected to be scheduled in May 2024.OutlookWe maintain a Buy on IOCL with a revised PT of Rs. 100 on inexpensive valuation of 4.8x/0.8x FY25E EPS/BV and FY24E dividend yield of ~10%.For all recommendations report,\u00a0click hereDisclaimer:\u00a0The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Net profit stood at Rs\u00a06,021 crore in the year-ago period.The state-owned oil marketing company's revenue from operations jumped almost 10 percent YoY to Rs 2.26 lakh crore. The numbers have managed to beat\u00a0CNBC-TV18 estimates of\u00a0bottom line at Rs 6,393 crore and top line at Rs 1.88 lakh crore.Average gross refining margin (GRM) for April- March 2023 was $19.52 per barrel, compared to $11.25 per barrel in April- March 2022, said the company. However, the suppressed marketing margins of certain petroleum products offset the benefit of increase in GRM.Indian Oil has been suffering under recoveries from sale of domestic LPG since FY22. To compensate for this, the Union government approved a one-time grant of Rs 10,801 crore and Indian Oil\u00a0has recorded this under revenue from operations in FY23.The company's board of directors have recommended a final dividend of ~Rs 3 per equity share for FY23, subject to approval by the members of the company.At 2:30 pm, Indian Oil shares were quoting at Rs 87 on the NSE, higher by 3.7 percent from previous close.\n       ",
    "The Nifty snapped a two-day rise and closed in the negative after witnessing a sharp rebound from the afternoon lows on March 20. Broader market indices fell more than the benchmark, reflecting higher panic among non-institutional players. The Nifty has formed a bullish hammer on daily charts after forming two Dojis, hinting at possibility of an upward reversal.As any bear market could have a pullback rally, the same can be expected from Indian indices too. The Nifty has witnessed a fall of almost 11 percent from the all-time high of 18,887 of December 2022.The indices have been making lower top and lower bottom formation on the charts, which indicates bearish trend for a longer time frame. However, the possibility of a pullback in the short term cannot be ruled out. For the last few trading sessions, a tug-of-war is on between the bulls and the bears.FIIs have been heavily short in last couple of months and their long-to-short ratio in index future has reached as low as 0.12, which is extremely oversold. A band of 16,800-16,850 has been a good demand zone and the same can act as a short-term support for the Nifty.We believe that the Nifty could show a move towards the 17,500-17,600 band in the short term and the same should be utilised to lighten long positions. A level below 16,800 would negate the chances of a pullback in the Nifty.Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:Manappuram Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 113 | Stop-Loss: Rs 107 | Targets: Rs 123-135 | Return: 19 percentThe stock price is in formation of bullish Inverted Head and Shoulder pattern on the daily charts.

    "Indian Oil Corporation on Friday said it will pump in Rs 250 crore in the West Bengal region in the current fiscal to ramp up infrastructure to push green auto fuels.The state-owned refiner and oil retailer said it has currently achieved ethanol blending of 7.5 per cent in the state against the national average of 10 per cent, with Bengal lagging behind in ethanol supply.\"However, supply chain issues will be sorted in due course and we will be able to augment blending and attain 20 per cent by 2025,\" IOC ED and State Head (West Bengal) LKS Chauhan said.The company aims at net zero operational emission by 2046.IOC is in dialogue with institutional and bulk customers like state transport agencies for more adoption of green fuels, he said.\"At present, green auto fuels are available at 275 pumps, but by 2024, we will increase it to 1,000 pumps out of 1,482 retail outlets in the state,\" Chauhan said.\n       ",
    "Sharekhan's research report on Indian Oil CorporationQ3FY23 PAT of Rs. 448 crore was significantly below our estimate due to continues high loss (posted Rs. 616 crore EBIT loss) in the petchem segment, a forex loss of Rs. 1,700 crore and probably inventory loss (IOCL did not provide details) as crude oil prices declined sharply q-o-q. Refining performance remains strong with reported GRM of $12.9/bbl (in-line), and a 13% q-o-q rise in refining throughput to 18.2 mmt. Marketing sales volume also rose by 8% q-o-q 24.3 mmt; however, petchem sales volume declined sharply by 48%/30% y-o-y/q-o-q to 0.37 mmt in Q3FY23. We believe that earnings downgrade cycle is largely over for OMCs and expect earnings to normalize over FY24-25 led by strength in GRM with likely normalised auto fuel marketing margins. Any spike in crude oil prices is a key risk to earnings recovery especially given OMCs inability to hike petrol/diesel price in inflationary environment.OutlookWe maintain a Buy on IOCL with a revised PT of Rs. 92 on inexpensive valuation of 4.6x/0.8x FY24E EPS/BV and FY24E dividend yield of 11%.For all recommendations report,\u00a0click hereDisclaimer:\u00a0The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.
