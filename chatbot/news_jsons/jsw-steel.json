    "The market failed to hold on to its record high due to selling pressure at higher levels, and declined sharply on May 3, as a result of which the Nifty 50 closed last week with just 0.25 percent gains. In fact, the index failed multiple times to surpass 22,800 since April, indicating the strong hurdle going ahead as surpassing and sustaining above the same can only open doors for the upper band of rising channel placed at around 22,950-23,000 levels, experts said.On the lower side, 22,350-22,300 is the immediate key support. If the index breaks the same support, then 22,200 is the level to watch. Further, the increasing volatility also pointed towards an uncomfortable scenario for bulls as India VIX, the fear gauge, jumped 43 percent in the last seven sessions to the 14.62 levels.For the week, the Nifty 50 was up 56 points at 22,476 and formed a Doji candlestick pattern on the weekly charts with continuation of higher highs, higher lows for yet another week, while on the daily charts, there was Bearish Engulfing candlestick pattern formation, the bearish reversal pattern.\"For now, the immediate swing low of the 22,350-22,300 subzone is likely to provide a firm cushion for any intra-week blip, followed by the 50 DEMA (days exponential moving average) of 22,230 and the bullish gap around the 22,200 zone,\" Osho Krishan, senior analyst - technical & derivative research at Angel One said.On the higher end, the record-high zone of 22,750-22,800 seems daunting for the bulls and until the market witnesses a decisive breakthrough, the next leg of rally toward the 23,000 mark seems demanding, he feels.Ashish Kyal, Founder and CEO of Waves Strategy Advisors also feels it is not going to be easy for bulls to take Nifty back above 22,800 immediately. \"On the downside 22,350 is immediate support. Any breach below 22,350 will be a bearish sign.\"Moneycontrol collated a list of top 10 stock ideas from experts with a 3-4 weeks perspective.

    "The market made a smooth rebound in the week ended April 26, following 1.65 percent decline in the previous week. The mood remained in favour of bulls, despite investors booking some profits\u00a0last Friday, forming a dark cloud cover pattern, which is a\u00a0bearish reversal trend, as experts feel the index has been in an upward sloping channel since the middle of January and, hence, as long as it holds 22,300-22,200 levels on a closing basis, a march towards 22,800 can't be ruled out.The Nifty 50 during the week rallied 1.23 percent to 22,420 and formed a bullish candlestick pattern with long upper shadow and a small lower shadow on the weekly charts, while major action was reflected in the broader markets, as the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices jumped around 4 percent each.\"Despite Friday's setback, the market mostly adopted a 'buy on dip' strategy, maintaining a bullish undertone,\" Rajesh Bhosale, technical analyst at Angel One, said.Going ahead, he feels the immediate support is seen around Thursday\u2019s low of 22,300, which coincides with 20-day EMA (exponential moving average), followed by the pivotal support of the bullish gap around 22,200.According to Jigar S Patel, senior manager - equity research at Anand Rathi, the Nifty is currently trading within a rising channel pattern, suggesting potential bullish momentum if it manages to maintain levels above 22,300 in the current week, with a likely target range of 22,750-22,800.Additionally, he feels the long-short ratio of foreign institutional investors (FIIs) stands at around 39 percent, indicating limited downside potential.Hence, immediate resistance levels for the Nifty are anticipated at 22,700-22,800, and a decisive close above this range could trigger renewed buying interest in index futures.Overall, experts advised traders to monitor these levels and focus on buying on dips while booking profits at higher levels.Moneycontrol collated a list of top 10 stock ideas from experts with 3-4 weeks perspective.

    "Leading Indian steel producers, including JSW Steel Ltd and Tata Steel Ltd, are expected to invest billions in a record capacity increase to benefit from rising domestic demand in one of the world\u2019s fastest growing economies.A spurt in economic activity and a revamp of broader infrastructure have drawn steel makers from around the world to India, where demand is rising. In Europe and the United States, it is falling.Analysts and company data showed major mills were planning to increase capacity by at least 22 million metric tons in the fiscal year beginning April 2024.Jindal Steel and Power is expected to add 6 million metric tons to existing capacity of around 9.6 million metric tons and Tata Steel said it was adding 5 million tons to its capacity of 21 million tons.JSW Steel, India\u2019s largest steel maker, has said in results reports it aims to increase capacity to 38.5 million tons by 2024/25, up from 27.5 million tons domestic capacity now.None of the companies has said how much it will be spending on capacity, although analysts, who said the expansion was unprecedented, predicted it would be billions.\u201dWe expect JSW Steel will spend $2-$2.2 billion a year towards brownfield expansions, scaling up its iron mining capacities in Odisha, raw material efficiency projects and downstream projects,\u201d Hui Ting Sim, an assistant vice president, Moody\u2019s Ratings in Singapore, said referring to the eastern Indian state.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Together with Japan\u2019s JFE Steel, JSW Steel said in February it would invest 55 billion rupees ($662.85 million) in an Indian joint venture to produce grain-oriented electrical steel, used in manufacturing transformers.Tata Steel meanwhile, is expected to spend between $1.21-$1.51 billion in 2024/25, Lakshmanan R, head of South & Southeast Asia corporates at CreditSights in Singapore, said.Anshuman Bharati, an analyst at S&P Global Ratings in Singapore, meanwhile, expected India\u2019s steel consumption would grow between 8% to 10% in 2024/25.During April-January, India\u2019s steel consumption rose by 14.5% to a six-year high of 112.5 million metric tons.\n       ",

    "JSW Steel\u00a0has appointed\u00a0 Robert Simon as the chief executive officer of the steelmaker's US unit.Simon will lead the overall business, comprising slab, coil, pipe and plate production, and sales at Baytown and Mingo Junction, the company said in a statement on March 6.\u00a0He will report to the respective boards of both the subsidiary companies of JSW Steel, the company said.In the US, JSW Steel has a 1.5 MNTPA (million tonnes per annum) electric arc furnace-based steel-making capacity in Ohio, and downstream product facilities, including a 3-MNTPA hot-rolling mill in Ohio, a 1.2 MNTPA plate mill and a 0.55 MNTPA pipe mill capacity in Baytown, Texas.In Q3, the mill in Texas produced 97,829 net tonnes of plates and 7,219 net tonnes of\u00a0 pipes reporting a capacity utilization of 40 percent and 5 percent respectively. Sales volume for the quarter stood at 86,985 net tonnes of plates and 5,532 net tonnes of pipes. It reported earnings before interest,\u00a0taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $18.67 million.In 2022,\u00a0Mark Bush stepped down from his role as Chief Executive Officer of JSW Steel USA to pursue other opportunities and\u00a0Chief Operating Office\u00a0 Greg Manfredi took charge on an interim basis.Prior to joining JSW USA, Simon\u00a0consulted with several companies, including OmniTrax, in Denver, Colorado, and also served as the chiefexecutive officer for the newly formed Bayou Steel Group, according to the statement.\n       ",
    "Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Steel has entered an agreement with the Italian government to revive its Piombino steel hub project with an investment of 143 million euros (Rs 1,281.9 crore), the company said\u00a0on March 1.JSW Steel\u2019s Italian unit signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the authorities to relaunch the steelworks site of Piombino, which includes conditions for efficient and sustainable state support for the production of rails. The company did not disclose details of the state support it will receive for the project.\u201cThe Italian steel industry is undergoing a transformative stage. JSW Steel Italy\u2019s investments to modernise the Piombino Steelworks site reiterates our commitment to partner with the Italian government\u2019s effort in the growth and economic development of the region,\u201d Sajjan Jindal, Chairman of JSW Group said.The MoU is also aimed at safeguarding employment and reducing the import of steel products into Italy. The investment will be used to double the current rail-making capacity to 600,000 tonnes per annum from 300,000 tonnes. JSW Steel Piombino is an iron and steel company, which manufactures specialty steel used in railway, automobile and earth-moving vehicles, among others.\u201cThe investments of Euro 143\u00a0million in modernising the rail mill at Piombino, will make the Piombino Rail mill, most modern, technologically advanced and best in-class rail mill in Europe,\u201d said Sajjan Jindal.The project includes setting up of tandem mill, head hardening facility and increasing the length of rails from 108 to 120 meters. The company\u00a0said that the broader part of the project is to kickstart economic development of the region which also includes the restarting of the production of Steel Products to safeguard employment and reduce the import of steel products into Italy.The Acquisition\u00a0\u00a0In 2018, JSW Steel Italy acquired a 100\u00a0percent stake in Aferpi SpA, Piombino Logistics SpA and a 69.27 percent of equity in GSI Lucchini SpA for a cash consideration of 55 million euro. The acquisition was aimed\u00a0to give\u00a0the Indian steelmaker a presence in Italy with access to the European speciality steel long products market.Soon after its acquisition in 2019-20, the Italy-based long-rolled products manufacturing facility reported an EBITDA loss of 31.91 million euro (Rs 236 crore) from 17.37 million euro (Rs 161 crore) a year ago. Loss after tax for the year amounted to 49.1 million euros (Rs 364 crore)\u00a0from 15.3 million euro (Rs 139 crore) in FY 2018-19, according to data from JSW Steel's annual report.The Italian business continued to languish and in FY 2021-22, it generated an EBITDA loss of 6.42 million euro (Rs 69 crore) compared to EBITDA loss of 22.65 million euro (Rs 191 crore) a year ago. Media reports suggested in 2022 that JSW Steel was mulling disinvesting the Italian operations partly with plans to retain the rail mill while selling other assets in that country.Why the decisionIn January this year, JSW Steel Joint Managing Director Jayant Acharya said in a post-earnings analyst call, \u201cOur Italian operations also reported robust performance, aided by improved realizations and rail orders from both the Italian government as well as exports.\"In the October-December quarter of 2023, the Italian unit's rolled long products manufacturing facility produced 97,933 tonnes and sold 73,833 tonnes of rolled products. It reported an EBITDA profit of 18.6 million euro for the quarter.JSW\u2019s revival plan comes after its peer Tata Steel entered\u00a0an agreement with the UK government in September 2023 to invest 1.25 billion pound in electric arc furnace steelmaking at the Port Talbot site. Earlier this year, Tata Steel said it would be shutting down the two blast furnaces in its Port Talbot Steelworks in Wales, which would impact 2,800 jobs.\n       ",
    "Steel tycoon Sajjan Jindal plans to borrow $750 million for capital expenditure purposes as India\u2019s largest mill targets a major capacity expansion, according to people familiar with the matter.JSW Steel Ltd, part of the $23 billion JSW Group, is sounding out lenders and a mandate is likely in the coming days, the people said, asking not to be identified as the information is private. The loan\u2019s tenor and pricing will be finalized later as the deal proceeds, the people said.The Mumbai-based firm\u2019s need for cash has been growing as it aims to almost double its steel output to 50 million tons by the end of the decade to meet rising demand from construction, energy and autos. Last week, it started work on a $7.8 billion complex in eastern India, and the company is also said to be in the\u00a0fray for a 20% stake\u00a0in Whitehaven Coal Ltd.\u2019s Blackwater coal mine.JSW Steel didn\u2019t respond to a query by Bloomberg News seeking comment on the fundraising plan.In January, JSW\u2019s board approved raising 20 billion rupees ($241 million) in funds through bonds. While its December-quarter profit\u00a0quintupled\u00a0from a year earlier, analysts have become wary of rising debt at the company. Net debt grew nearly 14% to 792.21 billion rupees at the end of December from a year earlier, though net debt to EBITDA fell to 2.64 times from 3.51, according to a filing.JSW is part of the O.P.

    "Companies are increasingly using liquified petroleum gas (LPG) as a cleaner alternative to carbon-intensive fossil fuels, a top executive of Confidence Petroleum said in an interview.\"We are being approached by industries to evaluate infusing LPG in a bid to increase cleaner fuel adoption in a cost-effective way,\" Confidence Petroleum business head for LPG, Rajashree Telharkar, told Moneycontrol in an interview.Telharkar added that steelmakers, such as JSW Group, have also reached out to the company. \"We are drawing plans for their Anjar plant in Gujarat. The LPG tankers will be brought to the plant and stored in bullets already there in the plant's existing infrastructure. We will construct the pipeline through which the LPG will reach the burner,\" she said.Asked about the development, JSW Steel, which has a plate & coil mill in Anjar, said, \"We are not using LPG in our reheating furnaces.\"Meanwhile, in 2023, Tata Steel said that the company is in talks with state-run GAIL Ltd for liquified natural gas (LNG) supplies to replace a significant portion of diesel used at its mines to cut carbon emissions. The steelmaker is looking to replace 25-30 percent of diesel used by its Heavy Earth Moving Machinery at its mines.Role of LPG in steel makingSo far, the gas has been used for melting and refining processes in the production of iron and steel as it facilitates precise temperature control and enables the efficient melting of raw materials.The industry is looking to use LPG for smelting purposes according to Confidence Petroleum. Smelting is the process of applying heat and a chemical-reducing agent to an ore to extract a desired base metal product.Currently, the steel industry relies on coke, derived from coal, to smelt iron ore to produce steel.\n       ",

    "JSW Steel Limited has announced a 50:50 joint venture (JV) with JFE Steel Corporation, Japan, to establish JSW JFE Electrical Steel Private Limited, a company focused on producing grain-oriented electrical steel in India. The manufacturing base will be in Karnataka's Bellary with a planned investment of Rs 5,500 crore.A groundbreaking ceremony took place on February 12 and the production is slated to begin in fiscal year 2027, with plans for further capacity expansion to meet the growing demand for this steel type in India, the steelmaker said in an exchange filing on February 13.The JV aims to address the rising domestic demand for such steel, JSW said\u00a0highlighting\u00a0that grain-oriented electrical steel is crucial for energy-efficient transformers.\"This collaboration is a milestone development, as it would be the first company to have end-to-end manufacturing of grain oriented electrical steel products in India. The JV aspires to cater to the surging domestic demand for grain oriented electrical steel and contribute significantly to the country's energy infrastructure,\" said JSW Steel in a statement.Grain-oriented electrical steel plays a pivotal role in the production of energy-efficient transformers. Whether in laminated, wound, or punched sheet form, it serves as the essential core material for distribution transformers, power transformers, and small transformers.The global grain-oriented electrical steel market size is projected to grow from $12.47 billion in 2023 to $18.81 billion by 2030, according to a research report from Fortune Business Insights. This is due to rising demand for electrical steel from the automotive industry for application in electric vehicles (EV).Recently, the JSW Group has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the government of Odisha\u00a0for electric vehicle \u00a0and\u00a0its battery manufacturing project at Cuttack and Paradip.

    "JSW Steel Joint Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer Jayant Acharya shares his expectations from the upcoming interim budget as told to Rachita Prasad, Editor, Energy and Infrastructure, Moneycontrol\u00a0in an exclusive interview on January 30.This is an interim budget. So we expect that the government will continue their focus on infrastructure spend and public capex, which has stood us in good stead over the last two or three years. Our focus on manufacturing to encourage self-reliance in India has been very good. We look forward to the government focusing on that as well.The transition to renewable energy has been a big focus and that is also going on quite well. I am quite confident that these spaces will continue to be a focus area for the government in the years to come as well. From a budget perspective, the only area where we need to be cautious is that imports into the country are increasing. Since we are a growing country, we need to be conscious of that and be cautious that we do not allow unfair trade into India. And if such things happen, then we need to take appropriate steps to control that.The biggest opportunity for the steel industry remains the growth in India; economic growth is our primary driver because a lot of steel consumption comes from the economic movement in India. That's a big opportunity for us. Our capacity expansions are focused on meeting the domestic demand. As far as the challenges for the industry go, we would need to be focused more in terms of looking at the imports and seeing that they do not become a drag concerning our business. Other than that, I don't think there is any immediate challenge which we see.JSW Steel Q3FY24 net profit surged five-fold year-on-year to Rs 2,450 crore, driven by strong India demand. Talking exclusively to Moneycontrol, Joint MD & CEO Jayant Acharya shares his outlook on demand and prices and explains why the company has trimmed its FY24 capex to Rs 18,000 crore from Rs 20,000 crore planned earlier.\n       "
