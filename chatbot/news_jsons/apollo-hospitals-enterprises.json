This has resulted into symmetrical triangle pattern breakout on the daily chart, which indicates the continuation of a primary uptrend.The only logical resistance, which is expected in the Nifty from here on is the all-time high placed at 18,887, which also happens to be the 50 percent Fibonacci extension level of the entire swing seen from June 2022 bottom to December 2022 top and from December 2022 top to March 2023 bottom.Above 18,887, the next resistance comes in at 61.8 percent Fibonacci extension, placed at 19,372 in Nifty.

    "The Indian equity market reversed all its previous week's gains and closed with more than 2 percent loss following nervousness in global peers. Inflation worries remained at the fore after the Reserve Bank of India raised its inflation forecast for FY23 by 100 bps to 6.7 percent and US inflation reading came in at 40-year high of 8.6 percent in the week ended June 3.Consistent FII selling, growth worries, imposition of some more Covid restrictions by China and oil hovering above $120 a barrel also dented the market sentiment. The market has fallen for the first time on weekly basis in the last four weeks.The Nifty50 has broken not only the 16,400 level but also 16,250 levels during the last week, hence holding of 16,200 is expected to be crucial in the current week (which is important as FOMC meet and CPI inflation lined up this week) as breaking of which can take the index down to around 16,000 mark, experts said, adding the volatility has not moved significantly on higher side despite sharp fall on last Friday, so the possibility of holding 16,200-16,000 levels is likely to be high.\"The market is unable to show any kind of strength at higher levels but we are still not getting convinced with the weakness. We would rather reassess the situation in the first half of the forthcoming week and all eyes on crucial levels like 16,000 on the lower side and 16,400 on the upside,\" Sameet Chavan, Chief Analyst-Technical and Derivatives at Angel One, said.The pragmatic strategy would be to stay light on positions, the market expert advised, suggesting to be stock specific as \"we see a lot of whipsaws\" on either side. \"In fact, it has become a nightmare in trading stocks in the last couple of weeks,\" said Chavan who still hopes to see some recovery in coming days.Here are the top 10 trading ideas by experts for the next three-four weeks. Returns are based on the May 13 closing prices:Vaishali Parekh, VP Technical Research at Prabhudas LilladherTVS Motor Company: Buy | LTP: Rs 763.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 730 | Target: Rs 850 | Return: 11 percentThe stock has initially given an Inverted Head & Shoulder neckline breakout above Rs 690 zone and further indicated a breakout above the Rs 750 levels with the bias maintained strong and has further upside targets of Rs 820-850 levels, keeping the stop-loss near Rs 730 levels.Apollo Hospitals Enterprises: Buy | LTP: Rs 3,700.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 3,500 | Target: Rs 4,100 | Return: 11 percentThe stock after the decent correction has stabilised currently and maintained the support zone near Rs 3,530 levels and gradually picking up. A decisive move past Rs 3,530 would improve the bias and can anticipate for further upward movement for higher targets.We suggest to buy and accumulate this stock for an upside target of Rs 4,000-4,100 levels keeping the stop-loss near Rs 3,500 levels.Torrent Power: Buy | LTP: Rs 466 | Stop-Loss: Rs 450 | Target: Rs 520 | Return: 12 percentThe stock has picked up well from the bottom made near Rs 418 levels near the trendline support indicated and after a short correction from Rs 485 levels again has taken support near Rs 450 levels to form a higher bottom formation pattern and regaining strength.We suggest to buy and accumulate for further upside targets of Rs 490-520 in the coming days keeping the stop-loss near Rs 450.Jatin Gohil- Technical and Derivative Research Analyst at Reliance SecuritiesDeepak Nitrite: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,853.4 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,700 | Target: Rs 2,278 | Return: 23 percentOn June 9, 2022, the stock reversed after testing its horizontal support line and extended gain subsequently. Its daily RSI (relative strength index) has given buy signal post a bullish divergence, which signals the stock is on the verge of a turnaround.This could take the stock towards is short-term supply zone (Rs 2,035-2050) initially and its long-term moving average 200-day SMA (Rs 2,278) subsequently.In case of any decline, the stock will continue to find support around its horizontal trendline, which is placed at Rs 1,700.Biocon: Buy | LTP: Rs 339 | Stop-Loss Rs 312 | Target: Rs 388 | Return: 14.5 percentOn week ended June 10, 2022, the stock again tested its 61.8 percent Fibonacci Retracement level of prior upmove (Rs 211-488), which was placed at Rs 317 and formed a bullish Engulfing pattern.In the past, the stock witnessed a sharp upmove after testing that Fibonacci Retracement level of prior upmove.The key technical indicators are positively poised on the short-term timeframe chart.

On the higher side, the stock faced hurdle around its upper band of the falling channel.The key technical indicators are in favour of the bears on the short-term timeframe chart. This could drag the stock towards its lower band of the falling channel, which is placed at Rs 165.In case of rebound, the stock will continue to face hurdle around its upper band of the falling channel, which is now placed at Rs 226.Sacchitanand Uttekar, Deputy Vice President - Research Technicals (Equity) at Tradebulls SecuritiesAditya Birla Capital: Sell | LTP: Rs 100.65 | Stop-Loss: Rs 106 | Target: Rs 90 | Return: 11 percentIt witnessed fresh breakdown evident on its daily & weekly scale as the stock breaks below its 4 days prior swing support zone of Rs 101.50. A bearish Pennant formation on its weekly scale too indicates weakness to persist from here on until a firm reversal is not established on its weekly scale.Immediate pattern target coincides with its 52-week low placed around Rs 90 which could be met in the next 2-3 weeks. Fresh shorts to be considered with a stop-loss at Rs 106.Coal India: Buy | LTP: Rs 198.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 190 | Target: Rs 220 | 11 percentIt was strong relative outperformer of the last week as it consistently maintained its shadows above its 5 DEMA (exponential moving average) & never closed below the same despite the persistent weakness across the market.The recent consolidation on its daily scale looks like a bullish flag in the making which suggests continuation of the on-going bullish sequence. The pattern indicates a price target up to Rs 220 which could be participated with a stop-loss below Rs 190.Adani Enterprises: Sell | LTP: Rs 2,203.1 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,260 | Target: Rs 2,020 | Return: 8.3 percentOccurrence of a Spinning Top formation on its weekly scale after a continued sequence of \u2018Inside bar\u2019 formations is a sign of diminishing strength. The stock has been facing stiff resistance around Rs 2,240 zone while its month RSI creeping lower below 80 in accordance with the on-going negative divergence since last 2 months.We expect Adani Enterprises to retrace back below its 20 weeks EMA (exponential moving average) zone below Rs 2,020 as most trend strength indicators exhibit signs of distribution since last few weeks.Shrikant Chouhan, Head of Equity Research (Retail) at Kotak SecuritiesDr Reddy's Laboratories: Buy | LTP: Rs 4,351.55 | Stop-Loss: Rs 4,200 | Target: Rs 4,640 | Return: 7 percentAfter a short term correction, the stock has formed higher bottom reversal formation. The stock is consistently taking support near 50 and 20 day SMA (Rs 4,192, Rs 4,227).The short term texture of the stock is still in to the positive and strong possibility of fresh uptrend rally is likely, if it succeeds to trade above Rs 4,200 level.Looking at the overall pattern it offers buying opportunity for the positional traders with a decent risk-reward ratio. The trend reversal move is likely to continue up to Rs 4,640.Adani Ports: Sell | LTP: Rs 726.4 | Stop-Loss: Rs 745 | Target: Rs 675 | Return: 7 percentThe stock corrected sharply from its all-time high level of Rs 924.65.

    "The market was about to snap a four-day losing streak as it opened higher and traded strong but the correction in the last hour due to Ukraine war wiped out all gains and finally benchmark indices lost more than\u00a0one percent, continuing southward journey for the fifth straight session.Most sectoral indices were caught in a bear trap with IT and FMCG being prominent losers with around\u00a0three percent loss. Bank, auto, financial services, metal and pharma indices were down one to\u00a0two\u00a0percent.The BSE Sensex plunged more than 700 points to 56,463 and the Nifty50 closed below the psychological 17,000 mark, falling more than 200 points to 16,959. The broader markets were also under pressure with the Nifty Midcap 100 index losing 1.4 percent and Smallcap 100 index declining 1.66 percent.Stocks that were in action include Apollo Hospitals Enterprises which was the biggest gainer in the futures and options segment, rising 5.75 percent to Rs 4,816; MRPL which hit a fresh 52-week high intraday and closed\u00a0nine percent higher at Rs 57.65; and Minda Corporation which ended at record closing high of Rs 251, up 4.78 percent.Among others, Genus Paper and Boards climbed 6.28 percent to Rs 22 and Vaishali Pharma surged 19 percent to Rs 111.80.Here's what Ruchit Jain of Angel Broking recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:Apollo Hospitals EnterprisesAfter a price-wise correction at the start of the calendar year, the stock has been trading within a narrow range which seems to be a time-wise correction. This entire consolidation has taken place above its 200 EMA (exponential moving average) which is now around Rs 4,425 and is important support.On the flipside, resistance is seen around Rs 5,000. A breakout beyond these levels will lead to the next leg of directional move and hence traders should look to buy on a breakout above the mentioned resistance.However, existing long positions can be held till the stock continues to hold above the moving average support.MRPLThe stock has given a breakout above the previous high resistance with very high volumes. This indicates buying interest in the counter and hence the stock could continue its upmove in the short term.However, the RSI Smoothened (relative strength index) oscillator on the daily chart is around the level of 90 which is overbought. Hence, one should wait for a corrective move within this uptrend and look for buying opportunities on declines.The support is placed around Rs 54 and any dip towards that can be used as a buying opportunity for a potential target of Rs 70. The stop-loss for long positions can then be placed below Rs 48.Minda CorporationThe stock is trading in an uptrend and has recently shown decent outperformance. The previous resistance of Rs 230 is now expected to become a support and hence any declines towards this support could be used as a buying opportunity.Traders can look to buy the stock on dips around Rs 230 for a potential target of Rs 275 in the next couple of months. The stop-loss for long positions can then be placed below Rs 218.Genus Paper and BoardsPaper stocks have been buzzing for the last few weeks and this stock has been forming a \u2018Higher Top Higher Bottom\u2019 structure which is a sign of an uptrend. The volumes have also been good in the recent upmove and oscillators are indicating a positive momentum.Traders can look to trade with a positive bias and accumulate the stock in the range of Rs 20-21 for a potential target around Rs 25. The stop-loss on long positions can be placed below the support of Rs 19.Vaishali PharmaThis stock has given a breakout from a long consolidation phase in the month of February and since then prices have rallied from Rs 40 to over Rs 110 now. Although the trend continues to be positive, the oscillators are deeply overbought and hence the risk reward ratio for fresh buying is not favourable.However, traders with existing long positions can continue to ride the trend by keeping a trailing stop-loss. The immediate support for the stock is now placed around Rs 95.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "Bears tightened their grip over Dalal Street with the benchmark indices falling seven-tenth of a percent as the rising Ukraine-Russia tensions and further spike in oil prices weighed on the market sentiment.The BSE Sensex fell 383 points to 57,301, and the Nifty50 declined 115 points to 17,092.All sectoral indices closed in the red with IT, FMCG, and Metal being the top losers, falling 1 percent each. The broader markets, too, were under pressure with the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices declining 1 percent and 2 percent.Stocks that were in focus include NALCO, Apollo Hospitals Enterprises and Metropolis Healthcare which were the second, third and fourth biggest gainers respectively, in the futures and options segment. NALCO gained 3.5 percent to close at Rs 115.50 after falling nearly 9 percent in previous four consecutive sessions.Apollo Hospitals Enterprises corrected 5 percent in previous four straight sessions, before closing the session on Tuesday at Rs 4,576 with 3.4 percent gains. Metropolis Healthcare was up 2.9 percent at Rs 2,033, while Indiabulls Real Estate surged more than 10 percent to Rs 113.65 after falling 19 percent in previous four sessions in a row.Here's what Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:NALCOThis counter seems to have reversed its trend, in favour of bulls, as it smartly bounced back from intraday low of Rs 108 levels. Interestingly, the said low not only coincides with the 62 percent retracement level of the last leg of rally from the lows of Rs 99 to Rs 128 levels but also interacts with the trend line support as shown on the chart.Therefore, as long as it sustains above Rs 108 levels it should head higher to test recent peak of Rs 128 where it appears to have formed a double top. Stop-loss suggested for this trade will be a close below Rs 108 levels.Apollo Hospitals EnterprisesThis counter, seems to be in a base building process, after the sharp cut from the highs of Rs 5,935 to Rs 4,150 levels, as it is moving in a zone of Rs 4,794 to Rs 4,300 levels for last couple of weeks.Bullish Engulfing formation of last trading session from the intraday low of Rs 4,300 on relatively higher volumes seems to have set the tone for a pullback rally.However, initial target for this pullback attempt shall be Rs 4,794 levels and a close above that shall confirm a sustainable upmove. Outlook shall remain positive as long as this counter trades above Rs 4,300.Metropolis HealthcareThis counter appears to be making efforts to stabilise, as hinted by the sideways move of last couple of trading sessions, after retracing 62 percent of its entire upmove from the March 2020 lows of Rs 998 to a high of Rs 3,571 levels.Hence, sustaining above Rs 1,933 levels it can make an attempt to pullback into the bearish gap zone of Rs 2,298 \u2013 Rs 2,363 levels.In case, as medium-term trend is down, if this counter registers a close below Rs 1,870 levels, then it can slide down all the way to Rs 1,550. If someone is holding then they are advised to maintain a stop-loss below Rs 1,925 levels.Indiabulls Real EstateThis counter appears to have registered a Harami kind of candlestick formation, on daily charts, hinting that trend for near term might be shifting in favour of bulls. Moreover, at recent low of Rs 99 this counter seems to have retraced 62 percent of the huge rally from the November 2020 low of Rs 46 to a high of Rs 196 levels.Hence, sustaining above Rs 99 levels it can make a pullback attempt with initial targets of Rs 132 levels. In case if this counter registers a close below Rs 95 levels then it can slide down all the way into the zone of Rs 76 to Rs 72 levels.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "Santosh Meena, Head of Research at Swastika InvestmartThe Nifty again respected its 200-DMA (day moving average 16,877) beautifully, gave confidence to the bulls, however the 20-DMA is acting as a strong resistance for many days that is currently placed at 17,325 level. Above this, we can expect the positive momentum to pick up towards 17,600-17,800 levels.If the Nifty surrenders its 200-DMA, then things may become ugly where 16,400-16,000 are the next important support levels.FIIs are still selling in the cash market but the momentum has come down a little bit despite the Russia-Ukraine's standoff and they are making bullish positions in the F&O market for the last few days which is also a positive sign.As per the open interest data, 17,000 should act as strong support for the Nifty ahead of expiry while 37,000-36,500 is a critical support zone for the BankNifty.Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:Apollo Hospitals Enterprises: Buy | LTP: Rs 4,576 | Stop-Loss: Rs 4,300 | Target: Rs 5,100 | Return: 11.5 percentThe counter is bottoming out at its 200-DMA following a meaningful correction where it has formed a bullish Engulfing candlestick formation with a double bottom chart pattern. The counter is in a very narrow range for the last many days where Rs 4,750 is acting as a strong hurdle. Above this, we can expect a swift move towards the Rs 5,100 level.Momentum indicator RSI (relative strength index) witnessed positive crossover with a positive divergence whereas MACD (moving average convergence divergence) also showed positive crossover however it is trading below the centerline.L&T Infotech: Buy | LTP: Rs 5,991 | Stop-Loss: Rs 5,600 | Target: Rs 6,600 | Return: 10 percentThe counter has created a strong base around Rs 5,600 level that coincides with its 200-DMA. It created a strong bullish candlestick formation near the major base with positive divergence in momentum indicators.On the upside, 20-DMA is acting as a strong hurdle that is currently placed at the Rs 6,075 level. Above this, we can expect a move towards a cluster of 100 and 50-DMA which is currently placed around Rs 6,600 level.Minda Corporation: Buy | LTP: Rs 195 | Stop-Loss: Rs 180 | Target: Rs 225 | Return: 15 percentMinda Corporation is outperforming the market and managed to hold important support of Rs 180 despite a sell-off in the overall market. It formed a bullish opening Marubozu candlestick formation from the support of Rs 180 in Tuesday's trading session.The overall structure is bullish where it is consolidating in the range of Rs 180-210 and a move above Rs 210 may lead to a fresh leg of the rally. Momentum indicator RSI is witnessing positive crossover from the support of 40 levels whereas other momentum indicators are also positively poised.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

The benchmark indices fell significantly dented by selling pressure across sectors, barring private banks and weak global cues.The BSE Sensex fell more than 550 points to 60,755 and the Nifty50 declined nearly 200 points to 18,113, while the broader markets corrected more than 2 percent.Stocks that were in focus include Prestige Estates Projects, which hit a fresh record high of Rs 554.90 before closing with 2.77 percent gains at Rs 526.65, and Gujarat Ambuja Exports, which rallied 3.96 percent to Rs 190.15.Infibeam Avenues rallied 8.5 percent to Rs 44.30, whereas Apollo Hospitals was the fifth biggest loser in the futures and options segment, falling 6 percent to Rs 4,615.80.Here's what Mazhar Mohammad of Chartviewindia.in recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:Prestige Estates ProjectsDespite hitting life-time highs, the medium-term trend of this counter seems to be sideways in a broader range of Rs 520 to Rs 400. In the last four months, with its price behaviour, it carved out a well-defined channel in which the upper bound acted as a supply point where as lower boundary witnessed buying interest.In the last session, it gave up all the intraday gains to close around the lowest point of the session. Hence, it may witness more selling pressure\u00a0in the next session, if it trades below Rs 522 levels. Therefore, we don't advise fresh longs unless it closes above Rs 555 levels. On such a close, initially Rs 590 can be expected.Positional traders who have own this counter shall either book profits and wait for a breakout above Rs 555 with a stop-loss below Rs 522 or exit if it fails to close above Rs 555 in next two sessions.Apollo Hospitals EnterprisesThis counter seems to have witnessed some critical breakdowns on weekly charts as in the current week it erased a four-week-old pull-back attempt from the lows of Rs 4,643 to a high of Rs 5,148 in the current week in which only two sessions passed.This faster retracement on the downside is hinting at more selling pressure with initial targets of Rs 4,351 levels and breach of this can drag it down further towards Rs 3,955 levels.For the time being, fresh long side bets should be avoided, whereas short-term traders who already invested in this counter, should exist either on pull back towards Rs 5,000 levels or triggering a stop-loss below Rs 4,500 levels.Gujarat Ambuja ExportsLast two trading sessions of sharp up-move on the back of massive volumes may be hinting at a breakout above its 94-day-old corrective and consolidation phase.Volumes with sharp price appreciation may be pointing at a trend reversal with a sustainable up-move. Moreover, as this counter is trading close to its life highs of Rs 202, beyond that a higher target of Rs 219 can't be ruled out.Hence, it remains a 'buy on dip' opportunity but with a stop-loss below Rs 180 on closing basis for a target of Rs 219.Infibeam AvenuesThis counter appears to be in a multi-week consolidation zone of Rs 58 - 37 for the last 10 months. However, last four weeks of price structure is in extremely narrow ranges and seems have formed a decent base around Rs 39.This was followed by sharp price rise on the back of massive volumes. Hence, positional traders are advised to adopt a two pronged strategy of buying now and add on dips in the zone of Rs 42 \u2013 40 levels and look for an initial target of Rs 57. Stop-loss suggested for the trade is a close below Rs 39.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

Experts largely feel 18,000 will be crucial for a sharp uptrend in the coming days and as long as the index holds 20-week simple moving average of 17,553, then the positive momentum would continue, however, 17,640 is going to be a crucial support.\"Looking at the price action, the psychological level of 18,000 will act as a key resistance level. If the prices manage to breach this level, then we might see further up move towards 18,210 (Swing High). The key support level is placed at 17,640 (Multiple touch point level), we expect this to act as a key support level going forward,\" said Malay Thakkar, Technical Research Associate at GEPL Capital.Looking at the options data, 18,000 CE and 17,500 PE have the maximum open interest.

However, in the later half of the month, prices took a pause and retraced some of the gains along with the broader market. But, rather than a price correction, the stock went through a time-wise correction as it has consolidated within a broad range in the last two-and-a-half months.Now, prices have hinted at initial signs of a resumption of the momentum as it has given a breakout from a falling trend line resistance. Looking at the price action and the RSI (relative strength index) readings, we expect a positive momentum in the stock and hence, it could resume its broader uptrend.Thus, short-term traders can look to trade with a positive bias and buy in the range of Rs 229-226 for a potential target of Rs 243-245. One can place a stop-loss below Rs 219 on long positions.UPL: Buy | LTP: Rs 788.95 | Stop-Loss: Rs 759 | Target: Rs 820 | Return: 4 percentThe stock has been consolidating within a broad range since last seven months and has not seen any directional move. In this consolidation, whenever the prices have traded below the Rs 700 mark, the stock has witnessed good buying interest.After this long consolidation, the stock finally witnessed a good momentum in last week in which it gave a breakout above its trend line resistance. Also, the volumes were good since the opening ticks itself on Friday indicating buying interest in the counter. Thus, we expect the stock to resume its broader uptrend and thus short term traders can look for buying opportunities.Hence, traders can look to trade with a positive bias and buy in the range of Rs 784-778 for a potential target of Rs 820. One can place a stop-loss below Rs 759 on long positions.Indiabulls Real Estate: Buy | LTP: Rs 166.15 | Stop-Loss: Rs 157 | Target: Rs 183 | Return: 10 percentIn the last couple of months, the stock has witnessed a corrective phase from the highs of Rs 195. However, the stock seems to have completed its price-wise correction and entered into a timewise corrective phase in the later half of December. If we look at the historical data, it is observed that the 89-day EMA (exponential moving average) on the daily chart usually attracts a lot of buying interest in the stock and this time too, this average has acted as a support in the stock.In Friday\u2019s session, prices hinted at initial signs of buying interest as price up move during the day was seen with rise in volumes. Hence, we expect the stock to resume its uptrend and rally towards the precious highs going ahead.Thus, traders can look to trade with a positive bias and buy around the current price of Rs 166 for a potential target of Rs 183 in next 3-4 weeks. One can place a stop-loss below Rs 157 on long positions.JSW Steel: Buy | LTP: Rs 672.85 | Stop-Loss: Rs 655 | Target: Rs 705 | Return: 5 percentAlthough the Metal index started correcting in the mid-October 2021, this stock has been correcting since August and has seen a price-wise as well as a time-wise correction.

The short-term bias remains weak with an upside resistance zone of Rs 5,200-5,300 levels.On the downside, any violation of the \"bullish gap\" area (Rs 4,800-4,688) on a closing basis may cause further weakness towards Rs 4,550-4,300 levels.Zee Entertainment EnterprisesOn the weekly chart, the past couple of weeks' price action has formed an \"engulfing bearish\" - a short-term trend reversal pattern.

    "The market extended losses amid volatility and fell half a percent due to correction in banking & financials, pharma and select metals stocks on November 17.The Nifty50 closed a tad below 17,900-mark with a loss of 100 points and the BSE Sensex fell over 300 points to end moderately above 60,000 levels. The broader market continued to show a mixed trend with the Nifty Midcap 100 index falling 0.67 percent and Smallcap 100 index rising 0.13 percent.Stocks that were in focus include Apollo Hospitals Enterprises, which gained 12.5 percent to close at Rs 5,733.95, L&T Technology Services (closed at Rs 5,675.50 with 5.75 percent gains),\u00a0Tanla Platforms and Barbeque Nation Hospitality - both were locked in 5 percent upper circuit at Rs 1,392.20, and Rs 1,610.25, respectively.Here's what Gaurav Sharma of Globe Capital Markets, recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:Apollo Hospitals EnterprisesIt is the biggest\u00a0healthcare stock in terms of market capitalization, and is better-placed among the listed peers. It has posted good up move in past couple of sessions, rallying from Rs 4,600 to Rs 5,800-plus levels in just 4 days.On weekly charts, breakout from N-formation is also witnessed which is backed by strong volume. Considering its overall chart pattern, we see it heading towards Rs 6,200 levels which is the first target of the above mentioned formation.L&T Technology ServicesThis stock is in strong uptrend, trading in higher highs higher lows formation from quite a long time. During the initial COVID impact that adversely impacted markets across the globe, this stock too witnessed the heat, corrected reasonably, fell from levels close to Rs 2,000 till Rs 1,160.Post this slide, steep rise have been witnessed and the stock price never looked back, it has multi-folded since then.Considering its past performance, we advise medium to long term buyers to stay invested and those who missed out can utilize dips to take fresh entry.Tanla PlatformsIt has consolidated in range Rs 750 till Rs 1,000 levels for almost eight months (February till October 2021) before steeply moving higher. In less than a month, it has moved up from Rs 1,000 to levels close to Rs 1,400. It had traded at upper circuit during that rise, on Wednesday i.e. November 17, it was at 5 percent upper circuit.It has surpassed upside target range of the rectangle formation it was trading in; hence, chances of some profit taking cannot be ruled out but that should not be considered negative. It should be used as an opportunity to go long as the overall trend is still quite strong.Barbeque Nation HospitalityThe stock quadrupled from its initial listing levels i.e. Rs 490. It has retraced 61.8 percent of the rise Rs 1,150-1,945 as per the Fibonacci Retracement theory. This is a healthy correction and if we go by this theory, chances of recovery are quite high.Hence, this is a good buying opportunity as apart from technical reasons, there are negligible chances that the third COVID wave will be hitting India and if that is so, restaurants are likely to have quite an impressive quarter ahead.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not that of the website or its management.

It has a resistance placed at 18,200 followed by 18,345 and 18,604. On the flip side, the support levels would be 17,600 and 17,450 levels.Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:Birlasoft: Buy | LTP: Rs 475.05 | Stop Loss: Rs 435 | Target: Rs 543 | Return: 14.3 percentBirlasoft has given a strong consolidation breakout with a volume confirmation which has been forming since last 5 months and made a fresh life time high which shows strong bullish undertone of the stock for medium to long term.

    "The market managed to add more gains in the morning on November 15 following a 1.3 percent rally in the previous trading session, but profit-booking at higher levels erased those gains in the afternoon to finally settle the day on a flat note.The Nifty50 continued to respect the 20-day SMA (whose value is placed at 18,068) and settled above 18,100 mark, while the BSE Sensex closed the session above 60,700 levels.FMCG, IT and pharma stocks helped the benchmark indices close with a positive bias, however, the selling pressure in metals and select banking\u00a0and financial stocks capped the gains.The trend in broader markets was mixed, with the Nifty Midcap 100 rising 0.32 percent and Smallcap 100 falling 0.25 percent.Stocks that were in focus include Apollo Hospitals Enterprises which was the biggest gainer in the futures\u00a0and\u00a0options segment, rising 8.81 percent to close at Rs 5,080.95, and Syngene International which rallied 6.95 percent to Rs 593.20. Metropolis Healthcare was also in action, hitting a fresh record high of Rs 3,352.45 before closing with 7.87 percent gains at Rs 3,337.95.Metropolis Healthcare and Syngene International were the third and fourth biggest gainers in the F&O segment. The buying was also seen in IRCTC, rising 4.46 percent to close at Rs 903.40.Here's what Mazhar Mohammad of chartviewindia.in recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:Apollo Hospitals EnterprisesAt a recent low of Rs 3,955 on this counter appears to have taken support around its channel lines after retracing almost 62 percent of its last leg of rally from the lows of Rs 3,141 to Rs 5,122 before resuming its uptrend. Since then, it seems to be in a steady uptrend which seems to have accelerated in the last session as it witnessed almost two-digit appreciation on the back of huge volumes.Hence, initially it should head higher to test its life highs present around Rs 5,198 and beyond that eventually a higher target of Rs 5,700 can\u2019t be ruled out.In today's (Tuesday) session, if it rallies without a correction then positional traders who already own this counter should book profits in the zone of Rs 5,150 \u2013 Rs 5,200 levels.In case it witnesses profit-booking in the early hours of trading sessions without much price appreciation then a dip between Rs 5,000\u00a0and\u00a0Rs 4,900 can be an opportunity to create fresh longs with a stop below Rs 4,800 on a closing basis.Syngene InternationalLarger trend of this counter seems to be sideways in a broader range of Rs 700 to Rs 500. Moreover, last 45-week of price behaviour seems to have carved out a channelled move.Interestingly, with two weeks of consolidation at lower end of the said channel, this counter appears to have positioned itself for resumption of upswing as it staged a strong comeback in the last trading session on huge volumes. Hence, sustaining above Rs 547 levels, this counter shall make an attempt to head towards its recent top of Rs 686.As this counter appears to have just initiated a fresh leg of rally, traders should adopt a two-pronged strategy of buying now and adding further on dips preferably in the zone of Rs 580 \u2013 Rs 560 levels by placing a stop below Rs 547 and look for a potential target of Rs 680.Metropolis HealthcareThis counter seems to have resumed its uptrend, with new life-time highs, as it registered a consolidation breakout from the 23-week trading range of Rs 3,230 to Rs 2,630 levels.Hence, as long as it sustains above Rs 3,085 levels a higher target, based on the width of consolidation range, of Rs 3,830 can be projected.Therefore, positional traders are advised to buy now and add on dips into the zone of Rs 3,200 \u2013 Rs 3,100 levels by placing a stop below Rs 3,085 levels.IRCTCThis counter seems to be in a consolidation mode after a cut of 50 percent from its life-time highs of Rs 1,279 to a low of Rs 639 levels. Interestingly, the current consolidation zone of 14 days seems to be inside the large bearish candle range, registered on October 25, present between Rs 937\u00a0and Rs 792.Hence, initially it needs to register a close above Rs 937 levels to confirm some kind of strength. In case it closes above Rs 937, then the strength shall expand towards Rs 980.For the time being, as the current up move is of pull-back nature, traders should consider booking profits on its inability to get past Rs 937 in the next couple of sessions.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not that of the website or its management.
