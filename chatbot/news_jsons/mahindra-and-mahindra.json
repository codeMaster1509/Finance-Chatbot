    "With XUV 3XO\u2019s bookings crossing 50,000 units within 60 minutes, Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) is drawing up a blueprint to ensure that the sub-compact (under four-metre) sports utility vehicle (SUV) does not see\u00a0months-long\u00a0\u00a0waitlists. Speaking after the company's Q4FY24 earnings call, Rajesh Jejurikar, ED and CEO, M&M Auto and Farm Equipment Services, said that a prospective\u00a0 customer, who could be a first time buyer, will not wait endlessly for the XUV 3XO as he has multiple options in the market.\u201cWe are\u00a0aware that when first-time buyers want a car, they are are not going to wait for months. That's something\u00a0 we are very alive to. The nature of this\u00a0buyer is different from the nature of Thar (lifestyle SUV) buyers, who don't mind waiting as there's nothing like that\u00a0 in the market,\u201d said Jejurikar.At present, Tata Motors\u2019 Nexon is the market leader in this segment, with sales of 1,71,697 units in FY2023-24,\u00a0per industry data . Maruti Suzuki Brezza is\u00a0 number\u00a0two,\u00a0with 1,69,897 units, followed by Hyundai Venue at third spot, with 1,28,897 units.Jejurikar revealed that M&M has already produced more than 10,000 units of this model and will commence deliveries on 26th May. He also said that the company\u00a0has already enhanced the XUV 3XO\u2019s production capacity\u00a0to 9,000 units per month, which is higher than the numbers for the outgoing version ( XUV 3OO).\u201cWe already have the inventory, and with a very short lead-time and minimal investment,\u00a0we can go up to 10,500 units (per month). Of course, if the numbers go higher than that, we will ramp up the output further,\u201d added Jejurikar.He also acknowledged that the company is very mindful that if the waiting periods are high, it may lead to higher cancellations.\u201cWe will have to keep up the momentum on the ground to drive demand, because it can't be a static customer list. If you're not delivering, they're going to drop out and buy something else. That's pretty clear to us,\" explained Jejurikar.The company reaffirmed its plans to roll out nine SUVs,\u00a0seven of which would be ICE models. While some models will be replacing existing product lines, some are tailiormade for the overseas markets.\u201cThere are ICE and EV portfolios that are getting developed, which will enable us to globalise over the next six to seven years. We'll take our time, and build market by market. But we need globally competitive products. When we say new ICE products, we mean it may be replacing existing models, but built on a totally new platform,\u201d said Jejurikar.Regarding\u00a0its Born Electric range of products, he said the company is all set to roll out the first model by the first quarter of next calendar year. Talking about positioning, he noted\u00a0that\u00a0it would be targeted at\u00a0 a new set of buyers, who are looking for aspirational electric cars at reasonable price points.\u201cI would put it as an attitude, or\u00a0 psychographic, of people who want to stand out, do things differently, experience new things, and are hungry for the latest tech. This product is going to come with tech which is unseen in vehicles\u00a0at way higher price points. We have been seeing a similar profile even among our ICE customers,'' averred Jejurikar.While the company has already launched its maiden EV XUV 400, which is based on the same platform that underpins XUV 3OO (now 3XO), its ground-up EVs will be priced above Rs 15 lakh.\u201cIdeally, we don't want the Mahindra ICE customer to move to our EVs. We are hoping\u00a0to\u00a0attract those we haven't been able to\u00a0so far, but who have the same psychographics. Then it's a win-win. Of course, there may be some cannibalisation, but we think that there is enough untapped opportunity for a vehicle of this type, which we have not been able to leverage so far with even the XUV700. This is a quantum leap over XUV700,\u201d said Jejurikar.\n       ",

    "LKP Research's research report on Mahindra And MahindraM&M reported decent Q4 FY24 numbers wherein the topline was reported at \u20b9254 bn, a growth of 12.7% yoy and flattish qoq. Volumes rose by 9.3% yoy and realizations went up by about 3.1% yoy. Automotive division revenues came in at \u20b9199 bn, an increase of 20% yoy led by success of Thar, Bolero, XUV & Scorpio families with ~220K order book. Automotive segment reported strong EBIT margins, which rose by 170 bps yoy and 50 bps qoq to 8.8% on positive operating leverage, stable commodity basket and model mix. Tractor margins came at 15.8% which was 30 bps up qoq and lower 60 bps yoy as lower monsoons and unseasonal rains led to fall in volumes but margins improved qoq on lower RM basket costs. Overall EBITDA margins therefore came in higher at 14% (flattish qoq and 160 bps up yoy). Lower other income coupled with higher tax rate, led PAT to come in 4.3% up yoy at \u20b921.6 bn. On a sequential basis, the growth was 12% lower. Overall results were quite decent despite tractor business being on weak wicket.OutlookWe maintain BUY rating on attractive valuations; SoTP-based target price now stands raised at \u20b92,740 (\u20b92,364 core business valued at 15x FY 26E earnings + subsidiary valuation of \u20b9376) in line with our assumptions of margin improvement on increase in volumes and value of SUV where we expect market share to bounce back on new launches, 3Ws and LCV segments, production increase offering operating leverage, price hikes and prudent cost reduction measures. We believe FES segment also to revive in FY 25E on expectations of above normal monsoons by the weather departments.For all recommendations report,\u00a0click hereDisclaimer:\u00a0The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Recently, it broke out convincingly from this range, presenting an attractive opportunity. Additionally, it breached the Bear trendline and closed above the upper Bollinger band, reinforcing the bullish sentiment.Notably, the Daily Stochastics indicator consistently avoided entering the oversold zone prior to the breakout, indicating sustained buying interest within the lower levels of the consolidation range. Consequently, we advise initiating long positions on HDFC AMC within the range of Rs 3,850-3,900, targeting an upside of Rs 4,275, with a stop-loss set around Rs 3,675 based on daily closing prices.Mahindra and MahindraIn the last 14 trading sessions, M&M has traded within the range of roughly Rs 2,010 to Rs 2,135.

The total SUV sales by carmakers grew by 15 percent on an annual basis in April 2024.Out of the total PVs sold in April 2024, Maruti Suzuki India Limited (MSIL)\u00a0 sold 1,37,952 units in the domestic market, as compared to 137,320 units during the same month last year. While\u00a0MSIL retained a market share of 40.8 percent, its SUV sales grew by of 38.6 percent YoY at 39,308 units.\u201cThe flat sales in the PV industry were due to two reasons. First of all, we started on the high base this (fiscal year) compared to last year. If you see the industry\u2019s network stock last year was much higher than his year. Another reason is the election phase which is going on along with the model code of conduct (coming in),\" Partho Banerjee, senior executive officer, marketing & sales, Maruti Suzuki, told reporters over a virtual call.He went on to add, \"Things will be the same until the month of June and after the new government formation we will see a revival in the market.\" He also reaffirmed that the industry will grow in single digits during the entire fiscal.Hyundai Motor India Limited (HMIL) revealed that its domestic wholesales saw an increase of 1 per cent to 50,201 units last month from 49,701 units in the year-ago period.HMIL COO Tarun Garg revealed that in April, it achieved a fourth consecutive month of 50,000-plus domestic sales this year on the back of models such as Creta, Venue and Exter and other SUVs contributing 67 percent of its total sales.In his view, \u201cIn both rural and urban markets, SUVs accounted for 67 percent of our total (domestic) sales, which is a significant departure from previous years when rural demand trailed behind urban markets by 5-7 percent. This transformation in the non-urban markets is largely due to the evolving needs and preferences of rural buyers, who are now seeking vehicles that have advanced technological and safety features.\u201dTata Motors\u2019 total domestic PV sales. including Electric Vehicles (EVs)\u00a0rose 2 percent to 47,983 units last month from 47,107 units in April 2023.Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd (M&M ), which recently rolled out the XUV 3XO subcompact SUV, sold 41,008 units of passenger cars in the domestic market in April\u00a0against 34,698 units in the same month last year,\u00a0a growth of 18 percent YOY.Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) revealed that its wholesales increased by 32 percent year on year to 20,494 units in April.

The company had reported sales of 4,551 units in April 2023.\u00a0\n       ",
    "By launching the XUV 3XO at Rs 7.49 lakh (ex-showroom), India\u2019s largest utility vehicle-maker Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) has undercut the Tata Nexon by Rs 60,000-65,000 (depending on the variant).\u00a0 Tata Nexon ICE version (priced in the range of Rs 8.15 lakh to Rs 15.6 lakh, ex-showroom), which was the market leader for the past two financial years, averages around 12,000-13,000 units per month.With the XUV 3XO subcompact Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV), the homegrown automaker is looking to target customers who aspire to buy an ultra-premium SUV XUV7OO\u00a0 (priced in the range of Rs 13.99 lakh to Rs 26.99 lakh ex-showroom), according to a top official of the company.In the process, the company aims to be the market leader in the hyper-competitive subcompact Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) market, where other models like Maruti Suzuki Brezza, Hyundai Venue and Kia Sonet are already present.\u201cIn this Rs 6 lakh segment (of subcompact SUVs), which is 25 percent of the market, we are actually the number fifth player. This is a big opportunity for us to disrupt. In the next three years, we target to be number one or two in the subcompact monocoque SUV segment. To plan for this, we have to do something disruptive and that is where the 3XO comes in,\u201d said Rajesh Jejurikar, executive director and CEO, auto and farm equipment sector, M&M.According to him, \u201cthe right to win\u201d comes out with the offer that one brings to the market. \u201cWe have done everything possible to create a proposition to ensure we have the right to win. It doesn\u2019t come only out of price, product, technology or features. It is a combination of getting everything right and we think we have done that.\u201dWithout sharing any sales target for the model, he stated, \u201cWe have set up a fungible capacity (along with XUV 4OO) of 9,000 units per month that will be expanded to 10,500 units per month.\u201dHe also clarified that 60-65 percent of the sales will be from gasoline-powered - version and 35-40 from diesel variant. However, he clarified that there won\u2019t be a CNG offering for this model in the near term.\u201cWe have a very aggressive gasoline strategy to encash on the size of the 65 percent share (in subcompact SUV segment.\u201d He also revealed that while it continues to do well in tier 2 and 3 cities, the \u2018real opportunity\u201d to pick up \u201csubstantial volumes\u201d for this model will be from tier 1 cities.According to him, the total size of the SUV market last year was about 2.5 million per annum and about half of that was in the sub four-metre segment at around 1.2 million (per annum). Within that, out of 50 percent is sub-four metre SUV segment, which it considers as the \u201cdirect relevant segment\u201d.Exuding confidence that the SUV segment will grow faster than passenger cars (sedans, hatchbacks) in FY25, he maintained that are not true-blue SUVs. \u201cA substantial chunk of SUVs in India are car crossovers. So, it is not a like-to-like comparison by saying that it\u2019s all pure SUVs (which are selling). I would say that the way SUVs are growing in India is faster than cars.\u201d\u201cBuoyed by this, existing and upcoming models (5-door Thar), we aim to grow in mid-teens in our overall volumes during FY 25, Jejurikar further added.Puneet Gupta, director, S&P Global Mobility is of the view that the XUV 3XO has the potential to revolutionize Mahindra's presence in the sub 4-meter SUV segment, enabling the company to capture a larger portion of the compact SUV market.\u201cGiven Mahindra's current dominance in the midsize SUV segment, they might be considering expansion into other sub segments as well. X3o at this price will be a game changer product and can be among the customer favourites due to fresh and stunning looks,\u201d said Gupta.\u00a0\n       ",
    "In a bid to take on Tata Nexon, Hyundai Venue and Maruti Suzuki Brezza, Mahindra and Mahindra (M&M) rolled out the XUV3XO subcompact Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) at a starting price of Rs 7.49 lakh (ex-showroom).\u00a0The top-end trim, which is the AX7 L trim, is priced at Rs 15.49 lakh (ex-showroom).\u201cThe total size of the SUV market last year was about 25 lakhs per annum and about half of that was in the sub four-metre segment at around 12 lakhs (per annum). Within that, out of 50 percent is sub-four metre SUV segment, which we are defining as the relevant target segment,\u201d Rajesh Jejurikar, ED and CEO, auto and farm sectors, M&M.While the Mumbai-based automaker will open online and offline orders simultaneously from May 15, the deliveries are set to commence from May 26.\u201cIn this six-lakh segment (of subcompact SUVs), which is 25 percent of the market, we are actually the number fifth player. This is a big opportunity for us to disrupt. In the next three years, we target to be number one or two in the subcompact monocoque SUV segment. To plan for this, we have to do something disruptive and that is where the 3XO came in from,\u201d added Jejurikar.The model will be rolled out from its Nashik facility, where its outgoing version\u00a0(earlier named XUV 3OO) was also made. The capacity of this facility is 9,000 units per month (including XUV 4OO electric SUV), which will be enhanced to 10,500 units per month in the medium term.The XUV 3XO will be available with three engine options (2 petrol and 1 diesel) and transmission options will include 6-speed manual, 6-speed automatic and a 6-speed AMT. \u00a0It gets several design changes on the exteriors which includes a panoramic sunroof and updated technology on the inside like level 2 of ADAS (advanced driver assisted system), 26.03 cm infotainment screen, Harman Kardon premium audio among many other things.Some of the safety features offered include hill descent control, hill hold control, vehicle dynamics control and traction control. R. Velusamy,\u00a0President, Automotive Technology and Product Development, M&M said, \"Built on a durable, well-tested platform, it is engineered to meet the highest global safety standards, including the B-NCAP.\u201dThe sub-four metre SUV was conceptualised at the Mahindra India Design Studio (MIDS) in Mumbai, and engineered and developed at the Mahindra Research Valley (MRV) near Chennai. Mahindra had spent Rs 650 crore for the development of the platform as well as for revamping the production line to build the newly-launched model.M&M has reconfirmed that XUV 3XO will be its most affordable SUV as it has no plans to relaunch mini-SUV KUV100.\u00a0 According to Jejurikar, any model below the XUV 3XO \u201cdoes not match its DNA\u201d.Meanwhile, M&M has reaffirmed that it is the largest sports utility vehicle (SUV) maker in India in terms of revenues, aided by models such as XUV 7OO, Thar, and Scorpio-N.\n       ",
    "Nearly six months after awarding 5-star ratings to Tata Safari and Harrier SUVs, the Global New Car Assessment Programme (Global NCAP) has awarded three, two, and one star ratings to Kia Carens, Honda Amaze, and Mahindra Bolero, respectively.This assessment marks one of the final evaluations under Global NCAP's Safer Cars for India initiative as the country transitions to its own Bharat NCAP safety evaluation program.The 2024 Kia Carens received a 3-star rating for adult safety and 5 stars for child safety. GNAP revealed that the overall build quality of the newer version has been improved by enhancing neck performance and restraint systems, according to GNAP.The Kia India Spokesperson did not respond to emails until the time of publishing this story.While disclosing the test results, Alejandro Furas, Global NCAP Secretary-General, said, \"There has been an improvement in Kia\u2019s rating for the Carens since our original test when the model scored a zero rating for adult occupant protection. However, we were expecting a better performance in the retest given the Carens is fitted with six airbags as standard.\"The Honda Amaze, which previously secured a four-star rating for adult occupant protection and one star for child occupant protection during its 2019 assessment, saw a drop in its ratings under more stringent testing standards. The sedan's rating dropped to two stars for adult protection and plummeted to zero stars for child safety.\u201cRegrettably, Honda did not take the opportunity to update the Amaze with more safety features which explains its disappointing score,\u201d added Furas.Honda Cars India Ltd. (HCIL), in an emailed response, stated that the South Africa-spec 2nd Generation Amaze had already been tested as 4 stars by GNCAP in 2019.\u201cThe latest test, based on new protocol, shows that the total score is of a 5-star level with a stable body shell. However, mainly due to the requirement of certain equipment like Electronic Stability Control and Side Curtain Airbags, it resulted in a lower rating,\" HCIL said in an emailed statement, adding, \u201cWe are dedicated to continuously working to enhance our vehicles on all parameters of Safety and improve them further at model change timing.\u201dThe Mahindra Bolero Neo, a sub 4m SUV widely acclaimed for its versatility and robustness, garnered a 1-star safety rating for both adult and child safety. The model was tested and showed low protection for adult protection in the frontal crash with an unstable structure, unstable footwell area, weak chest protection for the driver, and poor feet protection, according to GNCAP.\u201cWe at Mahindra are committed to delivering vehicles that ensure the safety and satisfaction of our customers and users. The Bolero Neo is the trusted utility vehicle of choice in India, owing to its robust build, highly dependable nature, and its innate capability to handle a variety of usage conditions. It has always complied with safety regulations that have been introduced over time and continues to be fully compliant with the latest Indian safety standards,\u201d M&M said in an emailed reply to queries sent by Moneycontrol.According to David Ward, President of the Towards Zero Foundation, this mixed set of results demonstrates that more effort is still needed from some manufacturers to prioritize vehicle safety in the Indian market.\u201cWe have seen a great deal of improvement throughout our #SaferCarsforIndia campaign, but it\u2019s clear that maintaining this safety momentum is crucially important. We will be discussing this and other key vehicle safety matters for India during an NCAP24 panel session later today.\u201d\u00a0\n       ",
