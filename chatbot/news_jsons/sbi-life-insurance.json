    "On February 1, listed life insurers saw their valuations erode by more than 10 percent as the Union Budget brought in tax rules that would shave off a big part of their business growth. Investors believed that the stellar growth trajectory of the industry was now a thing of the past and so valuations should come down.Since April, though, life insurance shares have gained, in a sign that the earlier expectations of growth deceleration were overdone. Shares of the largest life insurer, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), have risen nearly 1 percent. ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company Ltd's stock has gained nearly 2 percent, while Max Financial Services Ltd has gained roughly 1 percent. HDFC Life Insurance Company Ltd and SBI Life Insurance Company Ltd have gained more than 3 percent.So, what has changed for investors to be nibbling on life insurance stocks now? The answer: another change in tax rules and a returning optimism on growth.Tax lost is tax gainedIn the budget, the government had proposed that the proceeds of insurance policies with premiums in excess of Rs 5 lakh would be taxed in the hands of the holder. Further, the centre made the new tax regime, which removes almost all exemptions, as the default tax regime from 2023-24 onwards. To be sure, shifting to the new tax regime remains optional, but the government\u2019s intent cannot be ignored.These rules, which took effect on April 1, were seen as hurting business growth for the life insurance companies. After all, India\u2019s life insurers relied on deep-pocketed clients who invested lumpy amounts to avail of tax exemptions.But on April 1, another tax rule change took effect. The government removed the indexation benefit on debt mutual funds by bringing all of them under the marginal tax rate. Analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities believe that some of the investment into these debt funds could now reflow into insurance policies with a smaller premium size.\u201cNotably, income from non-linked insurance policies below Rs 0.5 million of the annual premium remain(s) tax-free; hence, we believe that some incremental flows from debt mutual funds may be directed to such policies. This will help offset the impact of the slowdown in high ticket (over Rs 0.5 million) policies,\u201d they wrote in the April 21 note.Further, there are mitigating tactics that can help insurers bypass the tax exemption rule. \u201cThe Rs 500k annual premium limit for tax breaks on traditional (par/non-par) products is seen as relevant to a small section of potential demand, given mitigations are possible (for example, splitting the premium between spouses in the same family),\u201d wrote Santanu Chakrabarti, an analyst at BNP Paribas India in a note.A stronger MarchListed life insurers lived up to the expectations of investors in the January-March quarter. SBI Life reported 11 percent growth in total annualised premium equivalent and profitability metrics, such as value of the new business. And its margins beat Street expectations. HDFC Life, too, reported healthy growth metrics but the acquisition of Exide Life resulted in an increase in expense ratios.That said, analysts believe that repeating growth in FY24 won\u2019t be an easy task for life insurers.The outsized business growth in the March quarter was expected as life insurers made last-ditch efforts to sell as many large-sized policies as possible before the tax changes took effect. The 59 percent surge in the ticket size of policies for the month of March shows this last-minute dash. For HDFC Life, this rush contributed to 35 percent of premiums in March.Even so, listed life insurers exceeded market expectations of business growth for the quarter. Analysts at Morgan Stanley pointed out that the 38 percent year-on-year growth in retail weighted received premium (RWRP) for the industry and 56 percent for private life insurers were much stronger than expectations. Data from the industry regulator showed that private sector life insurers reported 53 percent business growth for March, taking the overall growth for FY23 to 24 percent, on an annualised premium equivalent basis.Further, management guidance on growth in FY24 has been optimistic amid emerging concerns over the tax rule impact. Chief executives of life insurers have asserted that tax exemptions are no longer the driving factor for life insurance policies.All this is contributing to the interest among investors in life insurance stocks.Future imperfectThe growth in FY23 may have exceeded expectations but the outlook for FY24 is still cloudy. This explains why the gains in life insurance stocks have so far been modest. Further, investors are awaiting the fourth-quarter earnings of insurers such as SBI Life, LIC and HDFC Life in the coming weeks. The results of ICICI Prulife, which released its Q4 earnings on April 20, show that investors\u2019 assumptions on profitability and growth have been met.Meanwhile, the impact of the tax rule changes on life insurers will be fully visible only in the second half of FY24. Insurers are already putting in place mitigating measures through changes in pricing and the product mix. How much they will be able to reverse the impact on growth will be keenly monitored.Chakrabarti of BNP Paribas pointed out that current valuations reflect the concerns surrounding growth. \u201cWe continue to believe that current market prices reflect the fear of both a near-term revenue decline as well as a reduction in TAM (total addressable market),\u201d he said.Most analysts expect insurance stocks to be under pressure in FY24 given the growth concerns. At the same time, valuations look appealing for some after the sharp post-budget erosion. Re-rating triggers, though, are slim and should be visible two quarters down.\n       ",

    "Analyst optimism lingered mostly around banks and financials as of September-end as credit growth peaked at as high as 16 percent and the condition of the Indian economy improved post-pandemic.Data available with Bloomberg showed that most of the analyst optimism \u2013 measured as the percentage of analysts that have a \u2018buy\u2019 call on a stock \u2013 was centered around ICICI Bank, Larsen & Toubro (L&T), and ITC among others.ICICI Bank, which is one of the best performing bank stocks right now, has 52 \u2018buy\u2019 calls and just one \u2018hold\u2019 call, translating into an optimism score of 98 percent. The company has been delivering expectation-beating earnings for a while now and has become the apple of analysts\u2019 eye. Analysts have praised its top-of-the-class net interest margins and investments into technology that is reaping rewards now.L&T also has an optimism score of 98 percent with 40 \u2018buy\u2019 calls and a solitary \u2018sell\u2019 call. The stock is regarded as the best play on the infrastructure boom in India. The company is building some of the most important projects in the country including the Mumbai-Ahmedabad Bullet Train project. It also has maintained its run rate of fresh orders resulting in revenue visibility, analysts underline.Cigarette maker ITC is also one of analysts' top favourites with an optimism score of 97 percent. As many as 35 analysts are bullish on the stock with one analyst with a \u2018hold\u2019 call. The stock is also one of the best blue-chip performers of the current calendar year with returns of 51 percent.Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) and State Bank of India (SBI) are two more stocks in the financial space that have the same optimism score \u2013 96 percent. HDFC \u2013 the largest mortgage lender in India \u2013 is in process of merging with HDFC Bank which analystsbelieve will be value accretive. Hence, the stock has also attracted investors. Meanwhile, SBI which is the largest bank in the country is riding on a high credit growth phase and relatively cheaper valuations.Two top life insurers \u2013 SBI Life Insurance and HDFC Life Insurance \u2013 are the next two stocks where optimism is high. Insurance penetration in India remains very low and it is likely to go up as awareness increases. Analysts are banking on this trend and are bullish on these stocks.Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, UPL, and NTPC are others in the top 10 where analysts are most bullish. Analysts believe Sun Pharma is likely to gain from ramping up sales in the US. It will also benefit from rupee depreciation. NTPC is investing heavily in new energy which will become another source of revenue for the firm and hence grabbed attention.IT, metals continue to face flakFor another month, metals and IT sectors remained the pockets where analysts were not as bullish. JSW Steel, Wipro and Shree Cement were among the top stocks where the pessimism score was the highest. Pessimism score refers to the percentage of analysts that are not bullish on a stock.JSW Steel, which is a victim of rich valuation and declining metal prices, has 17 \u2018sell\u2019 calls and 9 \u2018hold\u2019 calls compared to 7 \u2018buy\u2019 calls. The steelmaker is also likely to face a slowdown in export sales as western countries will be under recessionary pressure that will lead to fall in demand.Wipro, along with Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and HCL Technologies, are IT stocks that are part of this list. IT companies, being export-facing, are also bearing the brunt of the slowdown in Europe and the US. Any recessionary phase leads to lesser tech spending and hence analysts have cut down their expectations.Besides them, FMCG majors Britannia Industries and Nestle India are others that are seeing a concentration of pessimism. Both companies have been struggling with a slowdown in demand in rural India, which is likely to become even more challenging as kharif sowing has been lower than expectations. That means rural income is likely to be lower going ahead. Rich valuations of both stocks is also playing spoilsport for them.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "Motilal Oswal's research report on SBI Life InsuranceSBILIFE reported a robust 1QFY23 with APE growth of 80% YoY (7% beat) and a sharp jump of 132% YoY in VNB (28% beat). VNB margin spiked 665bp YoY to 30.4% while shareholders\u2019 PAT grew 18% YoY to INR2.6b. Strong momentum in APE was reflected across all product segments. However, non-par savings stole the limelight in 1QFY23 with a massive growth of 645% YoY. It now forms 28% of business in APE terms. The growth was aided by a strong response to the newly launched product \u2018Smart Annuity Plus\u2019 in Mar\u201922. The notable improvement in VNB margin was primarily driven by a shift in underlying product mix with a larger share of high-margin products such as non-par savings and protection. Together, they constituted 39% of APE in 1QFY23 v/s 20%, a year ago. Retail protection APE growth of 54% YoY to INR2b is commendable, considering the muted performance of private peers. We raise our VNB margin estimates by 340bp and 270bp for FY23 and FY24 to 30.1% and 29.7%, respectively, and raise VNB estimate by 19% each over FY23/24. We expect SBILIFE to deliver 27% CAGR in APE over FY22-24, thus enabling 36% VNB CAGR, while RoEV sustains at ~22%. SBILIFE remains our preferred pick in the Life Insurance space.

    "Private life insurance companies finished FY22 on a positive note even as business in the first half of the year was dented by the second wave of the pandemic and a surge in death claims. The revival in growth and the expansion in margins underlined the performance of the listed private players.(image) In the last few years, the industry has focused on pure protection products (term assurance) that provide cover against mortality risk, and the annuity/savings segment,",

    "India\u2019s insurance whale, Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) will list today amid volatile equity markets. The initial public offer (IPO) of LIC fetched Rs 21,000 crore for the government at a price of Rs 949 per share.While the IPO size itself has been pruned from the initially expected amount, the issue witnessed robust demand, reflected in the large oversubscription from all categories of investors. To that extent, LIC has managed to keep the sentiment of investors buoyant amid discomforting market dynamics. Its listing comes at the backdrop of roughly 8 percent fall in benchmark equity indices over the past one month. Rising inflation and the specter of policy rate hikes have triggered concerns over corporate profitability and dampened market sentiment.Also read:\u00a0LIC listing today: What should investors do with the stock after it debuts on bourses?Listing gains are more a function of broad market sentiment and conditions and not just the share issuing company\u2019s business fundamentals alone. LIC\u2019s listing, if tepid, need not dismay its investors. As the country\u2019s largest life insurer is poised to list, it pays to look at the performance of its private sector rivals:ICICI Prudential Life Insurance CompanyListed private sector life insurance companies have had their soft periods after their IPOs. Among them, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company was the first to list in 2016. Recall that the life insurer\u2019s shares listed at 11 percent discount to its issue price of Rs 334 per share. On the day of its listing, benchmark equity indices were under pressure.\u00a0It took the company\u2019s shares more than three months to reach its issue price.Beyond the listing day, the shares have seen episodes of underperformance versus the broader market which was largely driven by the company underlying business performance. As such, the company\u2019s shares were under pressure owing to the pandemic.Be that as it may, more than five years since listing, ICICI Prulife\u2019s shares are now 58 percent above the issue price. An improvement in business grwoth metrics have played a big part in generating returns for its investors.SBI Life Insurance CompanyThe largest private sector life insurer offered its shares to the public for the first time in October 2017 through an IPO. Amid strong market conditions, SBI Life\u2019s shares listed at 5 percent premium on October 3, 2017. Since then, the shares have followed a robust trajectory, mostly helped by the company\u2019s strong performance. SBI Life\u2019s shares have been more volatile than its other peers, in part reflecting the volatility in its business performance as well. After a brief period of underperformance versus broad market in 2019, shares notched up sharp gains. Since the pandemic, SBI Life shares have given investors better gains than other listed peers. Investors in its IPO are sitting on 52 percent gain as of today.HDFC Life Insurance CompanyHDFC Life is the most valuable private sector insurance company and its business performance gave enough reasons for investors to cheer. The company launched an IPO weeks after rival SBI Life concluded its own. HDFC Life notched up 7 percent premium over its issue price on listing day. Its IPO investors are richer by 89 percent today. Much of this has been due to the life insurer\u2019s superior profitability metrics. Its value of new business and new business margins have consistently been above that of rivals. Even during lean times post the pandemic, HDFC Life\u2019s profitability metrics have been resilient. That said, its valuations have come under pressure partly due to anticipated regulatory limitations that may arise from the proposed HDFC and HDFC Bank merger. Further, the company saw a sharp rise in death claims due to the pandemic which dampened its earnings outlook somewhat.LIC\u2019s peers have had varied listing experiences, depending on the market conditions at that time. However, beyond the listing day the performance of the stock has closely followed that of the business. This is evident from ICICI Prulife\u2019s lackluster performance as business growth became a brief casualty of changed priorities. SBI Life\u2019s stock witnessed a period of pressure when the company failed to meet market expectations on business growth and HDFC Life disappointed investors after the pandemic took off some of its profitability shine.To ensure returns to its investors beyond the ultra short term, LIC just needs to demonstrate an improvement in its business metrics. It should start with arresting the market share loss the insurance behemoth has witnessed over the past decade.\n       "
