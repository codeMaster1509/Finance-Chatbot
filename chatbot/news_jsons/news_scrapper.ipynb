      "The Jio Financial Services Ltd (JFS) management said on August 30 that it is hopeful of getting regulatory approvals for business with US-based BlackRock Inc.In June 2023, the two companies had formed a 50:50 joint venture to launch asset management services in India and had pledged an initial investment of $150 million each, with hopes to democratise access to investment solutions for investors in the country.At the first annual general meeting after listing on stock exchanges, Jio Financial management said the BlackRock joint venture (JV) will help bring more investment products and that key leadership has been identified for the JV.Jio Financial management said the Reliance Industries Ltd's subsidiary is in advanced stages of go-to market strategy for BlackRock JV.Jio Financial management also said that Jio Payment Solutions is pursuing merchant tie-ups.In April, Jio Financial had said the BlackRock JV aims to tap into India’s increasingly lucrative wealth business and will include the incorporation of a wealth management firm and, subsequently, a brokerage company.In April 2024, Jio Financial announced JV with BlackRock to set up a wealth management and broking business in India.Last year, Jio Financial Services was demerged from Reliance Industries, with the markets ascribing a valuation of nearly $20 billion to the venture.At 3 pm on August 30, Jio Financial's shares were trading at Rs 323.25 apiece.\n",

      "Reliance Industries Ltd unveiled plans to double the conglomerate’s EBITDA over the next five years at its 47th annual general meeting, buoying investor sentiment.The drivers that will propel the Mukesh Ambani-led conglomerate towards doubling EBIDTA by 2030 include expansion in the oil-to-chemicals business, aggressive digital and retail pushes, and a renewed focus on new energy ventures.Reliance RetailWith announcements shared across RIL’s sectors, the consumer-centric businesses continue to post double-digit EBITDA growth. According to brokerage Motilal Oswal, both RJio and Reliance Retail are likely to record 25% and 19% EBITDA CAGR over FY24-26, respectively.“The growth would be driven by footprint additions, new categories in the retail sector, a focused approach to subscriber growth, and tariff hikes in the telecom business,” the brokerage said.Reliance JioAccording to Jefferies, the AGM largely focussed on Jio, with the traction in Airfiber and a foray into data centres.While Jio forms 8 percent of the total global data market, its data prices are a fourth of the global average and a 10th of developed countries. The current 5G adoption at 130 million-plus users will only rise as all smartphones over the price of Rs 8,000 each are 5G compatible, brokerages said. The 2G to 4G addressable market is over 200 million people.New Energy, O2CAt the AGM, RIL Chairman Mukesh Ambani announced that the New Energy business will match the profitability of the current O2C segment within the next 5-7 years. O2C is Reliance Industries’ largest profit base currently, contributing towards two-fifths of the EBIDTA and more than half of attributable PAT.RIL will invest Rs 75,000 crore in developing an ecosystem for the new energy economy, leading international brokerage CLSA to note that the conglomerate was prioritizing investments across O2C and New Energy.“In O2C, we see Refining and Petchem segments picking up from the current levels. Moreover, FY25 would witness the full benefit of the volume ramp-up at the MJ Field,” noted Motilal Oswal.Also Read | Mukesh Ambani predicts new energy earnings to match O2C division in 5-7 yearsValuationsBased on the AGM commentary, if execution is flawless and timelines are met, RIL’s share price could see an upside of 15-20 per cent over Emkay Global’s target price of Rs 3,335 per share. “The company targets ensuring its balance sheet remains robust,” said the brokerage. Nuvama retained its buy call, as RIL’s New Energy rollout shall not only add 50 percent-plus to profits but also re-rate valuations, including the O2C business, given its net zero-carbon target by 2035.Nomura noted that Reliance Industries’ EBITDA CAGR will be further boosted by a sharp increase in FCF generation and a sharp decline in net debt levels.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

      "Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) chairman Mukesh Ambani unveiled an ambitious vision to transform India’s largest conglomerate into a deep-tech and new energy powerhouse to drive growth and expansion.At the company’s 47th annual general meeting, Ambani outlined his strategy to harness cutting-edge technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI), 5G, and high-tech manufacturing, to propel RIL into a new hyper-growth orbit.Ambani said Reliance Jio, the telecom arm, is at the forefront of the company's transformation. With its fully homegrown 5G stack, Jio has achieved the world’s fastest 5G adoption, with over 130 million customers signing up for Jio True 5G in just two years. Ambani emphasised Jio’s commitment to democratising AI, offering powerful AI models and services to everyone in India at affordable prices.“Jio's proven platforms, growing patents, and talented professionals position us to lead India’s technological future. And we are doubling down on deep tech to further extend our competitive edge,” Ambani said.Ambani also announced the Jio AI-Cloud Welcome offer of 100 GB of free cloud storage for Jio users. The free storage offer will be available starting Diwali this year “bringing a powerful and affordable solution where cloud data storage and data-powered AI services are available to everyone everywhere,” Ambani said.Compared to Jio’s offering, Google charges Rs 130 per month for 100 GB storage, while Apple charges Rs 75 for 50 GB and Rs 219 for 200 GB.Ambani also announced the Jio AI-Cloud Welcome offer, which provides 100 GB of free cloud storage to Jio users starting this Diwali. This initiative positions Jio as a formidable competitor in the cloud storage market, where Google currently charges Rs 130 per month for 100 GB, and Apple offers 50 GB for Rs 75 and 200 GB for Rs 219.RIL is also pursuing new energy initiatives, with a focus on solar photovoltaic (PV) modules, advanced chemistry-based battery manufacturing, and electrolyser production. The company aims to commence production of solar PV modules by the end of this year and has begun construction of an integrated battery manufacturing facility with a 30 GWh annual capacity.Ambani expressed confidence in the company’s new energy sector, predicting that it will soon rival the earnings capacity of its traditional oil-to-chemicals (O2C) division.“Our new energy business will be the new jewel in Reliance’s crown. I foresee it becoming as big and profitable over the next 5-7 years as our O2C business, which we have built over the past 40 years. And I am confident that green fuels and AI-based solutions will become long-term growth engines for Reliance,” Ambani said.By harnessing artificial intelligence and new energy, Reliance aims to unlock revenue streams, boost efficiency, and reduce its carbon footprint. The move would also cement the company’s position as a global leader in transitioning to a low-carbon economy.Ambani highlighted RIL’s commitment to investing in emerging technologies, including AI, IoT, machine learning, and robotics, to establish a world-class manufacturing ecosystem. The company plans to invest up to Rs 75,000 crore to establish the Dhirubhai Ambani Green Energy Giga Manufacturing Complex, the world’s largest, most modern, modular, and integrated ecosystem at a single location.RIL’s recent capex trend reflects its commitment to long-term growth in the new energy sector, with investments of $2 billion out of a planned $10 billion for the first three years. Analysts predict that with much of the 5G-related capex now completed, the company’s focus will shift towards growth in consumer businesses and the rollout of its new energy ventures.Ambani told shareholders that the ongoing tech-driven transformation will propel the company into a new orbit of hyper-growth and multiply its value for years to come. With its strategic consolidation and focus on emerging technologies.\n",

      "Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani on August 29 said his family and senior management team are \"simply the trustees\" of the company and personal wealth holds \"no importance\" for him.\"I firmly believe that my family and I, and also other senior members of the management team, are simply trustees of this great institution. Personal or family wealth holds no importance for me,\" Ambani said during the 47th annual general meeting in Mumbai.What truly matters is our responsibility to pass on this precious institution to the next generation on a solid foundation. This will enable them to elevate Reliance to even greater heights of success, he added.Ambani said the company is undergoing a period of \"generational transition\" and therefore it is executing plans with \"utmost dedication\".\"In my previous addresses, I have discussed our philosophy and plans to enrich our institutional culture and perpetuate our value system, especially as Reliance navigates this period of generational transition.\"Ambani also pointed out that he is not in the business to \"pursue short-term profit\" and \"hoard wealth\". Rather, the focus is on to create a better India.\"We are not in the business of pursuing short-term profit and hoarding wealth.

      "Reliance Industries Limited is well on track to more than double in size before the end of this decade and grow faster in the decades ahead, said Chairman and Managing Director, Mukesh Ambani, while addressing the company’s shareholders at its 47th annual general meeting (AGM).“This will further cement our position among the most respected and valuable companies in the world,” Ambani added.He added that RIL’s value creation strategy for the future rests on the solid foundation of its track record, which is matched by very few companies globally.“When we celebrated our 40th anniversary in 2017, I had promised that Reliance would enter the world's Top 50 before our Golden Jubilee. I am pleased to inform you that this year, Reliance is among the world's Top 50 most valuable corporations. In July 2018, Reliance crossed the $100 billion valuation mark.  And in just six years, we have become the first Indian company to cross $250 billion in market value. In 2022, I promised that Reliance would double its value by the time we complete 50 Glorious Years in 2027” Ambani said in his address to shareholders.Talking about the conglomerate’s value creation roadmap, he mentioned that RIL is uniquely positioned to grow new businesses around the adjacencies of all its five growth engines - O2C, Retail, Jio, Media, and Green Energy and fuels.“Today, three of these engines have a valuation of over $100 billion each, and they will continue to grow even faster. As I have already explained, Jio and Retail are expected to double their revenues and EBITDA in the next 3-4 years,” Ambani pointed out, adding that he sees immense growth potential in the group’s media business.Ambani noted that RIL’s new energy business will be the new jewel in Reliance's crown.“I foresee it becoming as big and profitable over the next 5-7 years, as our O2C business, which we had built over the past 40 years. And I am confident that Green fuels and AI-based solutions will become long-term growth engines for Reliance,” he said.“I assure you that we will continue to operate within our prudent financial framework, allocating resources to projects and businesses that deliver superior returns to our shareholders while ensuring our balance sheet remains robust,” he added.Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

      "Reliance Industries Ltd chairman Mukesh Ambani said that he is devoting a significant amount of his time to expand the pool of capable leaders within the conglomerate, even as his three children have stepped up to take on greater responsibilities.“Akash, Isha, and Anant have just completed one year as board members. They have stepped up to take on greater responsibilities, as first among equals in Reliance’s next-generation leadership,” chairman Ambani said at the company’s 47th annual general meeting in Mumbai on August 29.Ambani’s speech showcased how the conglomerate has ambitions of becoming a deep-tech and advanced manufacturing company with the aim to align and propel the country’s goal of ‘Viksit Bharat’.“In addition to them (his children), we are mentoring a large team of dynamic and exceptionally competent young leaders who are eager to assume bigger roles at Reliance. We continue to grow our professional talent pool from around the world, aligning with our vision of making Reliance a global corporation,” he said.He said that building this pool of leaders is a key priority for the company.“As Reliance takes on new and greater challenges, we will need an ever-expanding pool of capable leaders – leaders who are fully committed to the purpose, philosophy, passion, and pioneering spirit of our founding chairman. I am personally devoting the largest part of my time to this task, along with our esteemed board members and senior colleagues. I am pleased to report that we have made tremendous progress in these efforts,” he said.The RIL chairman also spoke about Reliance Industries being a ‘national institution.’ He said, “I firmly believe that my family and I, and also other senior members of the management team, are simply trustees of this great institution. Personal or family wealth holds no importance for me. What truly matters is our responsibility to pass on this precious institution to the next generation on a solid foundation.”He also said that Reliance aims to set up international schools with an Indian heart and soul.\"To make this vision a reality, Reliance Foundation is proud to introduce our flagship Teacher Training initiative with our soon-to-be-launched School Leadership & Administration Programme,\" he said.Ambani also said that as Reliance will need an ever-expanding pool of capable leaders – leaders who are fully committed to the purpose, philosophy, passion, and pioneering spirit of its founding chairman.\"I am personally devoting the largest part of my time to this task, along with our esteemed board members and senior colleagues. I am pleased to report that we have made tremendous progress in these efforts,\" Ambani said.Back in August 2022 at RIL's 45th AGM Ambani had unveiled the succession plan at India's most valuable company, identifying his twin children Akash and Isha for leadership of the telecom and retail businesses, and youngest son Anant for the new energy unit.Reliance has three broad businesses — oil refining and petrochemicals, retail, and digital services that include telecom. Retail and digital services are housed in separate wholly-owned subsidiaries — Jio Platforms and Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd (RRVL). The oil-to-chemical or O2C business is a functional division of Reliance. The new energy business is also with the parent firm.Akash Ambani is a non-executive director on Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd board since October 2014 and the chairman of Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd since 2022.While Akash has been made functional head of Jio Platforms, Isha leads Reliance Retail Ventures. She is also a part of the Reliance Foundation, Reliance Foundation Institution of Education and Research, and Dhirubhai Ambani International School.Anant is a director on the Boards of Jio Platforms Limited since March 2020, Reliance Retail Ventures Limited since May 2022 and Reliance New Energy Limited and Reliance New Solar Energy Limited since June 2021. He is also a part of the Reliance Foundation.The $76-billion pivot toward green energy is the biggest transformation that Ambani is helming currently. It’s also a complex transition given Reliance’s roots in petrochemicals and crude oil refining and the continued out-sized contribution of the fossil fuel-led businesses to the conglomerate’s yearly revenue.Disclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

      "In the run-up to the Reliance Industries AGM for the year 2024, the shareholders of the oil-to-telecom conglomerate were rewarded with two pieces of 'good news': the first, the Competition Commission of India approved the Disney+ Hotstar merger with JioCinema, and second, the firm will consider a 1:1 bonus issue at a board meeting on September 5.The bonus issue will be the first since 2017, when RIL also issued bonus shares in a 1:1 ratio.\"When Reliance grows, we reward our shareholders handsomely. And when our shareholders are rewarded handsomely, Reliance grows faster and creates more value,\" said Mukesh Ambani, Chairman of Reliance Industries while addressing the shareholders during the 47th Annual General Meeting.Also Read | Reliance Industries to consider 1:1 bonus shares at September 5 board meeting, stock rises 2%Vinit Bolinjkar of Ventura Securities said, \" The bonus issue is a clear indicator that the firm expects continued earnings growth and wants to reward its shareholders for their loyalty. It will be seen as positive for investors though the move may not move the needle on the firm's market-capitalisation much.\"Independent market analyst Ambareesh Baliga concurred, believing that the bonus issue is sentimentally positive for Reliance Industries' stock price. Additionally, while the move will boost optimism surrounding RIL's shares, it will not have any impact on the fundamentals of the overall company.\"By offering a 1:1 bonus, not only do a wider base of investors get access to the stock but it also offers more liquidity in the RIL shares. The increased liquidity and potential for future value appreciation are likely to outweigh any negative impact on the share price,\" said Amit Goel, Co-Founder and Chief Global Strategist at Pace 360.\"The bonus announced by RIL is highly accretive to shareholders. The move is expected to pave way for accelerated wealth creation for shareholders. The bonus, along with the commentary, strengthens confidence in RIL's expected growth trajectory,\" noted Nirav Karkera, Head of Research at Fisdom.On a technical basis, the stock is trading at a neutral make-or-break level. Vinit Bolinjkar sees the RIL counter surging to levels of Rs 3,400 per share, which is an upside of almost 15 percent from the previous close.\"If Reliance Industries manages to close above Rs 3,050, we can expect further upmove. The first hurdle that the stock needs to cross is Rs 3,100, then we can expect it to scale up to Rs 3,200,\" said Ajit Mishra, Senior Vice President of Technical Research at Religare Broking.RIL bonus historyThe bonus issue announced is the first in seven years. This is only the fifth time the energy giant, which also has interests in retail and telecom has offered bonus shares. It offered 1:1 bonus shares in 1997, 2009, 2017. Prior to that, in 1983, shareholders received three shares for every five they held.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
