    "Mining conglomerate Vedanta Limited has received approvals from the majority of its creditors for a proposed demerger of businesses, marking an important step in the company's plan to split into six independent listed companies.\"I am happy to let all of you know that we have received the 52 per cent plus the additional percentage, which is required for us to reach 75 per cent. We have crossed that threshold as well. Most of the lenders have approved it,\" a senior Vedanta executive said in a recent bondholder conference call.The transcript of the call was reviewed by PTI.\"Some are pending for their committee meeting and some are pending for their board meeting. So, as we speak, we have already received 52 percent. The balance requirement will be met in a week or 10 days' time. And thereafter, we will file the application with the NCLT,\" he added.A major creditor \u2013 State Bank of India \u2013 had already granted its consent earlier, according to a banker aware of the development. This crucial approval is seen as the last major compliance requirement for the company, which was keenly watched by the market, and paves the way for the USD 20 billion demerger.The green light by the majority of the creditors comes at a time when Vedanta has shown significant progress in deleveraging. As of March 31, the company's net debt reduced by Rs 6,155 crore from December 2023, reaching Rs 56,388 crore, primarily driven by strong cash flows from operations and working capital release.Taking note, credit rating agencies have assigned stronger credit ratings to the company and its debt instruments.Icra assigned an A1+ rating to Vedanta's Rs 2,500 crore commercial paper on May 30. It granted the company a long-term rating of ICRA AA- and a short-term rating of Icra A1+ earlier in May. Similarly, Crisil and India Ratings have assigned long-term ratings of AA- and A+, and short-term ratings of A1+ and A1 on Vedanta, respectively.Vedanta's lenders include state-owned lenders like State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Punjab National Bank, Canara Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Union Bank of India and Bank of Maharashtra. Private sector banks \u2013 Yes Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, IDFC First Bank, and Kotak Mahindra Bank are also part of Vedanta's consortium of lenders.The demerger will create independent companies housing the aluminium, oil & gas, power, steel and ferrous materials, and base metals businesses, while the existing zinc and new incubated businesses will remain under Vedanta Limited.\n       ",

    "The country\u2019s largest lender, the\u00a0State Bank of India (SBI), has asked its employees to seek permission before opening demat or trading accounts with service providers outside the group.A breach of the instruction would be treated as gross misconduct and punishable, an internal circular, dated May 27, has said. Moneycontrol has reviewed a copy of the circular. \u201cNo officer/award staff shall open their or their wholly dependent family member\u2019s demat account and or trading account outside the State Bank Group without prior permission of his / her controller not below rank of Chief General Manager,\u201d the circular says.The SBI Group includes companies in the larger financial sector such as SBI Cards, SBI Life, SBI General Insurance, SBI Funds Management and SBI Pension Funds. SBI Securities is the broking arm of the group. \u201cBreach of these instructions shall be treated as a misconduct punishable amongst others under Rule No. 50(1), 50(4), 50 (11) read with Rule 66 of SBIOSR for officers,\u201d the circular says.A demat is an online portfolio that makes the process of holding investments such as shares, bonds, mutual funds and ETFs easier, doing away with the physical handling and trading paper shares and other documents.SBI is yet to respond to Moneycontrol\u2019s emailed queries.The bank has also asked the employees to submit their details and those of their \u201cdependent\u201d family members\u2019 demat account statements to their controllers for verification.The staff must also obtain de facto permission from their controllers within six months from the date of issue of the instructions or close such accounts during the period.And legal experts highlighted that a company cannot impose on its employees to use the services of the employer group. \"Banks and companies may issue caution to employees for trading as it is done during the normal working hours. Since they also have policies under which employees have to make declaration about their investments, they cannot prohibit using services outside their company or group,\" said Mukesh Chand, Senior Legal Counsel \u00b7 Economic Laws Practice (ELP).Demat account boomIndia had 151 million demat accounts at the end of the financial year 2023-24, data analysed by brokerage Motilal Oswal shows.

    "The State Bank of India (SBI) has refused to disclose under the RTI Act the details of the electoral bonds furnished to the Election Commission (EC), claiming that it is personal information held in a fiduciary capacity, even though the records are in the public domain on the poll panel's website.Holding that the electoral bonds scheme was \"unconstitutional and manifestly arbitrary\", the Supreme Court directed the SBI on February 15 to furnish the complete details of the bonds purchased since April 12, 2019 to the EC, which would publish the information on its website by March 13. Holding that the electoral bonds scheme was \"unconstitutional and manifestly arbitrary\", the Supreme Court directed the SBI on February 15 to furnish the complete details of the bonds purchased since April 12, 2019 to the EC, which would publish the information on its website by March 13.On March 11, the court dismissed the SBI's petition seeking an extension of the deadline and ordered it to disclose the details of the electoral bonds to the EC by the close of business hours on March 12. RTI activist Commodore (retired) Lokesh Batra approached the SBI on March 13 seeking the complete data of the electoral bonds in the digital form, as provided to the EC after the Supreme Court's order.The bank denied the information citing two exemption clauses given under the Right to Information (RTI) Act -- section 8(1)(e) that is related to records held in a fiduciary capacity and section 8(1)(j) that allows withholding personal information. \"Information sought by you is containing details of purchasers and political parties and hence, cannot be disclosed as it is held in fiduciary capacity disclosure of which is exempted under sections 8(1)(e) and (j) of the RTI Act,\" the response furnished by the central public information officer and deputy general manager of the SBI said on Wednesday.Batra had also sought the details of the fees paid by the SBI to senior advocate Harish Salve to defend its case against the disclosure of the electoral bonds' records, citing that the records are held in a fiduciary capacity and the information is personal in nature. It is \"bizzare\" that the SBI denied the information that is already on the EC's website, Batra told PTI.On the question of Salve's fee, he said the bank has denied information that involves taxpayers' money. The EC published the data furnished by the SBI on its website on March 14, with the details of the donors and political parties that redeemed the bonds.On March 15, the apex court pulled up the SBI for not furnishing the complete information by withholding the numbers unique to each electoral bond that would help match the donors with the recipient political parties, saying the bank was \"duty-bound\" to reveal the information. A five-judge bench headed by Chief Justice D Y Chandrachud said it had directed the disclosure of all the details of the bonds, including the names of the purchasers, amounts and dates of purchase.All details have to be furnished by the SBI, the CJI observed, as the court admonished the bank for furnishing incomplete information, a day after the EC put out the entire list of entities that purchased the bonds for making political donations. The SBI had said a total of 22,217 electoral bonds of varying denominations were purchased by the donors between April 1, 2019 and February 15 this year, of which 22,030 were redeemed by political parties.\n       ",

    "In big relief to debt-ridden PC Jeweller, country's largest lender, State Bank of India (SBI) has accepted\u00a0 the One Time Settlement (OTS) proposal submitted by the company, the company informed the stock exchanges on March 13.The terms of OTS includes cash and equity component, release of securities and mortgaged properties, the company said. The development is significant as P C Jewllers has been in talks with lenders led by SBI for an out-of-court settlement for a long time.The company owes over Rs 3400 crores to a clutch of lenders.\u00a0 PC Jeweller's troubles began in February 2023, when banks decided to recall loans advanced to it after it was revealed in a filing that the company had defaulted on loans worth Rs 3,466 crore from banks and financial institutions. Loan recall is a process where the source lender requests the return of the amount advanced to the recipient or borrower.The company, in its annual report for fiscal 2021-22, stated that it had borrowed money from 14 banks, including SBI, Indian Bank, Union Bank and Punjab National Bank. In the annual report, the company said it owed the banks Rs 3,278 crore, which included the interest and the base amount.The largest lenders are SBI with Rs 1,060 crore outstanding, Union Bank of India with Rs 530 crore, Punjab National Bank with Rs 478 crore and Indian Bank with Rs 226 crore.In June 2023, SBI moved an insolvency plea against PC Jeweller Limited, National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) issued notice in the plea and sought for PC Jewller's response. In response to SBI's plea, PC Jeweller filed a 26 volume response to its 19 volume plea.On\u00a0 January 9, the\u00a0NCLT was on January 9 informed that there have been certain developments in settlement talks between\u00a0 SBI and PC Jeweller over repayment of the latter's loan.Senior counsel Nagesh, who appeared for SBI further told the court that the\u00a0 top management of is presently considering the settlement offer made by PC Jeweller.

    "Bernstein downgraded shares of the State Bank of India to 'market-perform' citing limited upside\u00a0and raised its target price for\u00a0the stock to Rs 780 from Rs 710 on the bank's willingness to improve its capital levels. The broking firm also highlighted factors that would drive underperformance in public sector banks, compared to their private peers.At 10.34am, shares of SBI traded 0.1 percent higher at Rs 788.95. The stock has gained over 33 percent in the past six months.Bernstein said that although public sector banks have outshone private lenders in the past three years, going ahead, investors should switch to private sector banks. The broking firm sees a less promising trajectory for state-run banks as they struggle with weaker deposit growth and much lower liquidity buffers resulting in a weaker earnings growth compared to private banks.Bernstein said that the liquidity headroom is a lot lower than what the loan-to-deposit ratio might suggest, given the higher investments for public banks are a result of higher deposits and cannot be reduced to be on par with private banks.Aggressive pricing in loans and deposits by public banks is forcing a growth-margin tradeoff that will result in muted earnings growth. So, even if public sector banks squeeze out the remaining liquidity buffers to match growth, the higher loan growth will not translate into earnings growth, said Bernstein.The brokerage firm said that with the recent rally, the market cap to pre-provision operating profit (PPOP) ratio for public banks is more than 0.6X that of private banks, despite their deposit growth rates remaining less than 0.6X of private banks.Also Read |\u00a0Price-volume action in banking stocks signal resurgence; PSU lenders outperform "
