This is true even for FIIs who have an option to invest in other countries.\"If the country's returns are going to be attractive over the next three to five years, a 20-30 basis point or even a 50 basis point reduction in returns is not going to be a major deterrent,\" he said.Follow our live blog for all the market actionThe Union Budget for 2024-25 hiked the long-term capital gains (LTCG) tax on all financial and non-financial assets to 12.5 percent from 10 percent, while short-term capital gains (STCG) tax on some assets would be 20 percent.Although there was a temporary sell-off by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) following the announcement, Mishra said that this will not have a lasting impact on market trends. \"We did see FII (Foreign Institutional Investors) selling yesterday (July 23), but frankly, I don't see this having a lasting effect.\"When asked about the rationale behind the adjustments to capital gains tax, Mishra said, \"I think the objective of this whole exercise was to reduce the distortion in savings or flow of savings caused by differentials in tax rates.\"Mishra said that previously, there was a complex mix of long-term and short-term capital gains taxes varying by asset class.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

We are handling almost 1.2 billion transactions on behalf of Paytm every month,\u201d Kumar said in an exclusive interview with Moneycontrol.The RBI cracked the whip on PPBL on January 31, imposing severe business restrictions citing\u00a0 a long history of non-compliance with prudential regulations by the company\u2019s promoters.After this, on March 14, Paytm informed the exchanges that the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has granted approval to One97 Communications Limited (OCL) to participate in UPI as a Third-Party Application Provider (TPAP) under the multi-bank model.Paytm further said four banks - Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, State Bank of India and\u00a0 YES Bank - shall act as PSP (Payment System Provider) banks to OCL. \u201cYES Bank shall also be acting as merchant acquiring bank for existing and new UPI merchants for OCL,\u201d the exchange filing said.On March 15, Moneycontrol reported that Yes Bank and Axis Bank went live on Paytm app. Yes Bank has gone live with a closed user group of users with @ptyes handle and Axis Bank has gone with @ptaxis handle.Last month, Kumar, during a post-result press conference, said that the bank has registered around 5 million monthly transactions on Unified Payments Interface (UPI), since its partnership with Paytm.\u201cBefore the partnership with Paytm, we were seeing around 3.3 million UPI transactions and now we are seeing 5 million monthly transactions on UPI,\u201d Kumar had said.The bank, Kumar said, has around 55 percent market share in UPI transactions by merchants. \u201cOur market share in merchant UPI transactions is around 55 percent. This gives us an advantage on fee income and we may look at cross-selling products to them in future,\u201d he said.The bank reported a net profit of Rs 451 crore for the January-March quarter of financial year 2023-24, which marks a 123 percent jump, compared to Rs 202 crore in the year-ago period.Yes Bank's gross non-performing asset (NPA) stood at 1.7 percent, down from 2.2 percent in the same quarter last year. On the other hand, net NPA for the quarter stood at 0.6 percent, improving from 0.80 percent on a year-on-year basis.

    "The stock market halted its downtrend on Friday and Nifty 50 managed to defend the 21,900 mark. As long as the index holds this level, the rangebound trade may continue, with attempts towards\u00a022,200-22,300. If it closes below 21,900, Nifty 50 may then correct up to April lows of 21,776, according to experts.The 21,900 mark coincides with the rising support trendline, low of the big bearish candle on May 9 as well as the lower end of the Bollinger band.Overall, the trend is still in control of the bears. For the week ended May 10, the Nifty 50 fell 1.87 percent to 22,055 and formed a large bearish candlestick pattern on the weekly timeframe following Doji candlestick pattern formation in the previous session.\"Thursday's low coinciding with the 89EMA at 21,900 serves as immediate support, followed by previous swing lows in the 21,800 - 21,700 range,\" Rajesh Bhosale, technical analyst at Angel One.On the upside, the zone between the 20 and 50EMA, around 22,200 - 22,300 presents a formidable obstacle, he feels.Jigar S Patel, senior manager - equity research at Anand Rathi said the index is nearing the lower boundary of an upward channel, and a breach could signal deeper market concerns. \"Looking ahead, a drop below 21,900, the previous swing low of 21,777, may induce market panic.\"Conversely, the FIIs' long-short ratio in index futures at around 32 percent suggests an oversold market nearing a potential rebound. Hence, he feels the resistance is expected at 22,300, and closing above the same may be potentially confirming a bottom until election results.He advised traders to remain light from here on as the market is now approaching the final phases of the election.Moneycontrol collated a list of top 10 stock picks\u00a0recommended by experts\u00a0from\u00a0a\u00a03-4 week perspective.

    "Fitch Ratings on Thursday affirmed the ratings of Axis Bank and ICICI Bank with a stable outlook citing supportive operating environment and large domestic franchise.Fitch Ratings has affirmed India-based Axis Bank and ICICI Bank's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BB+', the global agency said in two separate rating commentaries.Fitch has also affirmed the banks' Government Support Rating (GSR) at 'bb+' and Viability Rating (VR) at 'bb'.Fitch said its IDR ratings reflect expectation of a moderate probability of extraordinary state support from the government relative to large state banks.The agency said its expectation of a supportive operative environment is on account of India's robust medium-term growth potential. Fitch expects GDP growth of 7 per cent in 2024 and 6.5 per cent in 2025, supported by investment prospects.\"The economy has been resilient as healthy business sentiment, steady financial markets and the government's capital spending buffered global economic headwinds and inflation. These factors are conducive for banks to sustain profitable business, provided risks are well-managed,\" Fitch said.With regard to Axis Bank, Fitch said the bank's appetite for growth is likely to remain above the sector average, albeit similar to other large private banks.\"We have revised the outlook on Axis' earnings and profitability score to stable, from positive, as we do not see a significant further upside to the core metric from current levels, despite remaining high relative to the years before FY23,\" it added.On ICICI Bank, Fitch said it maintains a positive outlook on its earnings and profitability score, as it expects profitability to remain elevated relative to prior years.On ICICI Bank's large domestic franchise, Fitch said the bank has a strong retail-focused domestic franchise as India's second-largest private bank.\"This, together with above-average capitalisation, should support sustained generation of revenue and business opportunities as well as market-share expansion through the cycle,\" it added.\n       ",
    "Axis Bank Ltd is on a lookout to hire Asian expatriates to help the lender win business from multinational companies.The bank, that recently overtook Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. to become the third largest private lender in India, is targeting mid-sized companies in this area, the fastest growing business in its corporate banking division. It sees this as an \u201cunder-served\u201d market by global banks, according to Rajiv Anand, Axis\u2019 deputy managing director.Axis is focused on companies from countries like South Korea, Japan, US, Germany, Italy and France that have good ties with India. Getting the inside track into South Korean and Japanese firms has proven tougher however, due to language and cultural barriers, according to Anand.The bank is seeking to bring on board expatriates who can help make connections with companies and their executives, Anand said. So far, it has hired a Korean expatriate, based in the southern city of Bangalore, and a Japanese, who was relocated to Mumbai.Financial firms in India have been on a hiring spree, though the country doesn\u2019t have the depth of domestic talent that other more established markets do. Headhunters see the likes of investment banks seeking to bring professionals who carved out careers abroad back to India and Bloomberg Intelligence said finance professionals in the country may be in line for a 10% pay rise this year, outstripping rival locations in Asia.Axis is ranked second behind HDFC Bank Ltd. for arranging local currency loans in India so far this year, and fifth place for foreign currency loans, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n       ",
    "KR Choksey's research report on Axis BankAXSB\u2019s Net Interest Income (NII) grew 11.5% YoY/ 4.4% QoQ to INR 130,890 Mn in Q4FY24. NII was 2.5% higher than our estimates. The Bank\u2019s PPOP (Pre-Provisioning Operating Profit) for the quarter was INR 105,357 Mn, a growth of 14.9% YoY/ 15.3% QoQ led by a robust growth in non-interest. The PPOP was higher than our estimates driven by the higher non-interest income compared to our estimates. Net profit before exceptional items grew 17.4% QoQ/ 5.4% YoY to INR 71,297 Mn in Q4FY24, primarily led by higher operational income. The net profit deviation stood higher on the back of higher operating performance.OutlookConsidering the Bank's consistent performance and improved asset quality, we revise our target price to INR 1,345 per share (earlier INR 1,275), applying a 2.0x P/ABV multiple to its FY26E adj. book value.

    "LKP Research's research report on Axis BankAxis Bank has reported strong results with several positive takeaways: 1) Accomplishing the aspiration of ROE of more than 18% for 4QFY24, 2) Healthy credit growth (14.2% YoY, 3.5% QoQ). 3) Strong other income growth (38.2% YoY, 21.8% QoQ) driven by treasury gains. 4) Lower C/I ratio of 46.9% compared to 49.5% in 3QFY24. 5) Increased disbursement in retail and SME loans. 6) Strong contingent provision buffer (1.3% of gross loans). 6) Sequential improvement in NPA (GNPA/NNPA ratio 1.43%/0.31%) driven by lower slippages. 7) Restructuring (14bps of GCA) squeezed further and at manageable levels with 20% coverage. Additionally, CDR ratio improved to 90.3% compared to 92.8% in the previous quarter. However, the negative aspect is the higher-than-expected provision expenses (\u20b911.8bn vs \u20b910.3bn in 3QFY24). Furthermore, we believe the negatives are well provided for and anticipate growth to continue going forward.OutlookWe value the standalone bank with PBV of 2.2xFY26E Adj. BVPS of \u20b9575 and reach price target to \u20b91,322. We recommend BUY rating with potential upside of 17% from current level.For all recommendations report,\u00a0click hereDisclaimer:\u00a0The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.
