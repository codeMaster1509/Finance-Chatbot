    "Sun Pharmaceutical Industries is expected to post a 22 percent increase in earnings in the January-March quarter, driven by strong sales of its specialty drugs, contribution from blockbuster generic cancer drug Revlimid and resilient growth in the domestic market.Sun Pharma's Q4 net profit is likely to climb to Rs 2,412.60 crore from Rs\u00a01,984.50 crore in the year ago period, according to a poll of eight brokerages collated by Moneycontrol.\u00a0The company is slated to report its Q4 results on May 22.Revenue is likely to grow almost 12 percent to Rs\u00a012,241.25 crore from Rs\u00a010,930.60 crore a year earlier, according to the poll.Sharekhan had the most bullish earnings target for Sun Pharma, while Kotak Institutional Equities pegged the least growth.Strong speciality and US sales\u00a0Sun Pharma's high-margin, low-competition speciality segment will continue to drive growth in Q4. Brokerage SMIFS attributed the growth in Sun Pharma's speciality segment to a ramp-up in prescription volumes for\u00a0dermatology drugs Ilumya, Winlevi, and Odomzo.ICICI Securities expects Sun Pharma's\u00a0speciality portfolio sales at $284 million in Q4, driven by Ilumya and Winlevi.\"Sun Pharma is increasing its contribution towards speciality drugs where it faces lesser competition and can command premium prices,\" Sharekhan said in its report.In addition, blockbuster cancer drug Revlimid will remain a significant contributor to Sun Pharma's US sales. JM Financial pegged a $30 million contribution from Revlimid in Q4.The resumption of supplies from the drugmaker's Mohali plant, which was caught in regulatory snags, will aid Sun Pharma's US sales.Steady domestic growthAside from its US sales, Sun Pharma is expected to deliver mid-teen growth in its India revenue. Nomura expects the company's growth in the domestic formulation segment to remain ahead of the broader market.Most brokerages anticipate a 11-15 percent on-year rise in Sun Pharma's sales from the India formulation segment.However, the company's EBITDA margin may moderate slightly on account of weak seasonality in the speciality segment and higher research and development spending.Kotak Institutional Equities anticipates Sun Pharma's R&D spending to come in at about 7 percent of revenue in Q4, up 30 basis points from the previous quarter.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "The US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) has released a detailed report on six observations it reported following a recent inspection at Sun Pharmaceutical Industries plant in Dadra.The US drug regulator had classified the plant as Official Action Indicated (OAI) after the inspection that took place between December 4 to 15 last year. \u201cWe will work with the regulator to achieve fully compliant status,\u201d Sun Pharma had informed exchanges on the matter on April 11.An Official Action Indicated (OAI) is the most stringent regulatory designation, as defined by the US FDA. It signifies that regulatory and/or administrative measures are likely to be recommended for the facility. This classification indicates that the regulatory body has issued observations to the plant and found the company's response to be unsatisfactory or insufficient. Facilities marked with OAIs typically undergo re-inspection by USFDA officials to ensure compliance before being cleared of any regulatory concerns.Specific observations in the Dadra plant include the following:1. Out of Specification (OOS) investigations are not thoroughly carried out to determine the root cause(s) for long-term stability samples failures for the drug products sold into the US market.2. Equipment and utensils are not cleaned and maintained at appropriate intervals to prevent contamination that would alter the safety, identity, strength, quality or purity of the drug product.3. There is a lack of Quality Unit oversight on the issuance, handling, retrieval and reconciliation of GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) documents that are used in the manufacturing of drug products at the site.4. Procedures describing the handling of written and oral complaints related to diug products are deficiently written or followed.5. The firm failed to submit a Field Alert for Product Quality Complaints6. Reserve samples from representative sample lots or batches of drug products selected by acceptable statistical procedures are not examined visually at least once a year for evidence of deterioration.The recent OAI classification for Sun Pharma's Dadra unit comes on the heels of regulatory challenges faced by its Halol and Mohali facilities, leading to a downturn in the company's generic sales.Dadra's specialisation lies in the production of oral solid dosage forms and the manufacture of the blockbuster drug Revlimid, a vital revenue driver for Sun Pharma's generics segment. Taking into account Revlimid's substantial contribution of $170 million, Nomura projects Dadra's annual sales to the US market to hover around $240 million in FY24.\n       ",
    "Regulatory troubles\u00a0continue for Sun Pharma as the drug manufacturer\u2019s Mumbai unit has been issued an \"official action indicated\" (OAI) tag by the US\u00a0Food\u00a0and Drug Administration, which may affect new launches.Analysts at HSBC expect the FDA move to add to the regulatory overhang for the drugmaker, while those at Nomura see it as a negative surprise.After a 4 percent fall in the previous session, shares of\u00a0Sun Pharma\u00a0opened\u00a0another 2 percent lower on April 15.The\u00a0OAI classification for Sun\u2019s Dadra unit\u00a0follows recent regulatory trouble for Halol and Mohali facilities in the recent past, which had an impact on Sun Pharma's generic sales.In that backdrop, Nomura said the recent development is likely to increase concerns among investors.HSBC also expects the drugmaker's US generic sales, excluding cancer drug Revlimid, to remain range-bound due to regulatory issues.Follow our market blog to catch all the live updatesNomura anticipates new product approvals from the site\u00a0to be stalled until the compliance requirements are addressed and FDA clears the site.\"In our view, it is likely that new approvals may not come through from the site over the next two years factoring in the time for remediation and subsequent reinspection by the USFDA,\" the brokerage said in a note.The existing sales from the plant however, could sustain, unless the remediation measures require temporary suspension of production, Nomura said.The Dadra formulation site makes oral solid dosage forms. The\u00a0site\u00a0also manufactures\u00a0blockbuster drug Revlimid, which is a significant contributor to Sun Pharma's generic revenue.\u00a0Including Revlimid contribution of $170 million, Nomura estimates a contribution of around $240 million in annual sales from the Dadra site to the US market in FY24.In the wake of delays in new generic launches, HSBC said specialty sales remain key for Sun Pharma's earnings growth, offsetting challenges in US generics.The drugmaker's strong standing in the specialty segment, however, has HSBC bullish on growth prospects. The brokerage retained its \u201cbuy\u201d call on the stock with a price target of Rs 1,790. Nomura has a \u201cneutral\u201d call on Sun Pharma, with a target price of Rs 1,444.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "Nifty took investors on a wild ride this week as it climbed steadily throughout the week but surrendered most of its gains on April 12 due to concerns about rising US inflation, delay in interest rate cuts, and heightened geopolitical tensions. The coming week will be crucial for the market as fresh worries regarding the Israel-Iran conflict emerge.Iran launched its first direct attack on Israel with explosive drones and missiles on April 13, raising a threat to security and peace in the Gulf region. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that Israel has been preparing for a direct attack by Iran.The event also garnered attention from leaders around the globe. Any significant escalation in tensions may incite panic selling and heighten volatility in global stock markets, said analysts.Also Read |\u00a0Israel-Iran tensions: How should investors navigate the impact on financial market?In the upcoming holiday-truncated week, investors will be watching for developments in the Middle East. Here are some stocks that will remain in focus due to escalating tensions between Israel and Iran.1. Adani Ports: Adani Ports owns the Haifa port in northern Israel. It completed the purchase in January 2024 for about US$ 1.03 billion and operates the port with a local partner. Although the war has not yet impacted the port in any way, a broader escalation in the conflict could make critical infrastructure within Israel, such as this port, a potential target.2. Sun Pharma: Sun Pharma\u2019s subsidiary, Taro, is an Israeli firm. If some of the staff is potentially called for active duty in the war, it could impact production to an extent but it is unlikely to have a big impact on Sun Parma\u2019s overall consolidated financials.3. OMC stocks: If the Iran-Israel conflict deepens, it is expected to drive crude prices higher to potentially hitting $100 per barrel in the near future. This may directly hit the stock of Oil Market Companies (OMCs) such as Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL), Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL).These scrips may see increased volatility as higher crude prices not only put pressure on marketing margins but also lead to a rise in working capital requirements since OMCs import crude oil to meet the country's petroleum products demand. As crude prices rise, they need to spend more on imports.4. Paint Stocks: Whenever crude oil prices go up, the paint sector is hit hard as the main inputs in the manufacture of paints are crude oil derivatives. These companies have no control over these input prices.If tensions in the Middle East escalate pushing crude price to above $100 per barrel, stocks of paint manufacturers like Akzo Nobel India, Berger Paints, Indigo Paints, and Shalimar Paints may come under pressure as crude derivatives account for almost 40 percent of the input bill for these paint manufacturers. A rise in the price of crude can mean narrower profit margins.Also Read |\u00a0Israel-Iran escalating tension to trigger correction in equities? Check Nifty, Bank Nifty levels to watch5. Tyre stocks: Since the tyre industry uses crude oil derivatives for manufacturing synthetic rubber, several tyre stocks including MRF, CEAT, Apollo Tyres, JK Tyres, and Goodyear Tire & Rubber India will remain in focus as a rise in crude price will hit their margins.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "Sun Pharmaceutical Industries shares dropped 3.4\u00a0percent as the US FDA labelled its Dadra facility as 'official action indicated' (OAI), indicating recommended regulatory or administrative actions.The stock was trading at Rs 1,549.30 on the BSE, down 3 percent from previous close.Following an inspection from December 4 to 15, 2023, Sun Pharma disclosed the classification status in an exchange filing.Sun Pharma Ltd recently announced that the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has approved Winlevi (clascoterone cream 1 percent) for treating acne Vulgaris in patients aged 12 and above. This approval grants Sun Pharma exclusive selling rights in Australia starting June 24 (Q1FY25). Sun Pharma holds rights to sell Winlevi in the US and Canada since FY22.Additionally, the company has exclusive development and commercialisation rights for Winlevi in the US, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Mexico, and Russia from Cassiopeia SpA. Winlevi is a key product in Sun Pharma's portfolio, alongside Ilumya, Cequa, Levulan, Absorica, Odomzo, Bromsite, Xelpros, Yonsa, and Sezaby, contributing to the growth of its global specialty sales.\"We expect Sun Pharma\u2019s global specialty segment sales growth to get a boost from the recent additional marketing approval for Winlevi in Australia. We, therefore, increase Sun Pharma\u2019s sales and net income estimates to 10.9 percent and 16 percent CAGR, from 10.6 percent and 15.3 percent CAGR\\. We also increased the valuation multiple by 10 percent to 32x on FY26 EPS. The company has been seeing steady growth in revenue and net income over the last few quarters on the back of strong growth witnessed in specialty revenue, which now corresponds to 19.2 percent of overall sales as of Q3FY24 as against 16.5 percent it was in Q3FY23 and 16.4 percent it was in Q2FY24 and market outperforming growth in IPM\", KR Choksey said in its latest note.Sharekhan predicts that Sun Pharma, serving as a proxy for specialty sales in the US, will continue to grow significantly despite a higher base. This growth is driven by investments in the R&D pipeline, with specialty R&D accounting for around 40% of total R&D spending. The partner product Nidlegy is expected to file for approval in Europe during H1CY24E, enhancing Sun Pharma\u2019s offerings in skin cancers and complementing its Odomzo franchise in Europe. Additionally, Sun Pharma and its subsidiary have entered a licensing agreement with Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc, granting exclusive rights to use Deuruxolitinib, Sun Pharma\u2019s JAK inhibitor, or other forms of Ruxolitinib, for treating alopecia areata.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "Frontline pharmaceutical majors Cipla, Sun Pharma and Dr Reddy\u2019s have had bumper earnings over the last few quarters, thanks to the high-margin blockbuster cancer drug Revlimid.But that effect could soon wear off in the coming quarters because of the high base effect and the impending entry of peers like Aurobindo Pharma who will be allowed to sell the drug. The patent for Revlimid will eventually expire in January 2026.That means the Big 3 of the Indian pharmaceutical industry will need to have other tongs in the fire to maintain the growth in earnings.The Revlimid factorRevlimid sales make up a significant chunk of overall revenue and profit margins for companies like Dr Reddy's Labs, Cipla, Sun Pharma and Zydus Life.HDFC Securities estimates Dr Reddy\u2019s to earn $372 million from Revlimid out of the expected US revenue of $1,159 million for FY24.Strong contribution from Revlimid not only helped Cipla report its highest quarterly US revenue for the third straight time in Q3, but will round up around $165 million in sales for FY24 and $185 million for FY25 according to Elara Capital.For Sun Pharma, however, the opportunity is quickly diminishing due to loss of market share and its strategy to focus on specialty rather than generics.Also Read |\u00a0Revlimid overdose boosts Dr Reddy's Q3 earnings, but turns brokerages cautiousDr Reddy's game planTo make up for the loss of Revlimid contribution along with divestment of certain domestic brands, Dr Reddy's is looking at acquiring other companies with complementary portfolios. The company has Rs 5,910 crore in its kitty, and is said to be eyeing opportunities in US, India, Europe, and other markets.Faster product filings is the other strategy. The firm has identified 25-30 material product launches for FY25-30, HDFC Securities said. Meanwhile, the drugmaker also sees its recently acquired Mayne portfolio scaling up and gaining volume in the US.However, analysts worry that the increasing competition in key products will hurt volumes and market share loss, and keep base business growth under pressure in the near term.Cipla\u2019s trump cardsCipla is banking on two major launches, respiratory drug Advair and cancer drug Abraxane, both commanding a $700 million revenue opportunity each to make up for the loss of Revlimid sales.However, the twist is that both these launches have faced repeated delays due to regulatory issues at two of Cipla's manufacturing units - Goa and Pithampur, where the drugs were to be manufactured. Due to these delays, the full effect of these launches can now only be seen from FY26 instead of FY25.Regardless, the management has hinted towards a significant undisclosed peptide product launch in Q1 of FY25 which according to Elara Capital can more than offset the delay in Advair and Abraxane.Also Read |\u00a0Delayed drug launches to hurt Cipla\u2019s earnings in FY24Sun Pharma\u2019s specialty betSun Pharma is looking to bet heavily on global specialty products and reduce dependence on US generics. This could hit near-term earnings, believes Nomura.On the other hand, upsides from product-specific opportunities in generics and specialty will be realised only with a lag, according to Nomura.Sun Pharma\u2019s global specialty sales have rose 29 percent on year to $871 million in FY23, going from making just 7 percent of total sales in FY18 to the current 16 percent.Nonetheless, Sun Pharma still has the expected launch of Deuruxolitinib, filed recently for alopecia areata which could aid its momentum in the second half of FY25. The firm discovered the molecule by applying its recently acquired Concert Pharma's deuterium chemistry technology. As per Elara Capital's estimate, the product could become a $200 million opportunity, exclusively for Sun Pharma in the next couple of years.The drugmaker also recently launched Sezaby, which is the first and only product approved in the US for treating seizures in neonatal patients. Factoring that in, HDFC Securities expects momentum to continue for Sun Pharma in the near term with traction in existing specialty products like Ilumya, Winlevi, Cequa (prescription growth in H1 FY24) and the recently launched Sezaby.\"Sun Pharma's pipeline (five molecules under clinical phase), Concert acquisition (deuruxolitinib), M&A (strong balance sheet), and in-licensing (has commercial infrastructure in a few large markets) will drive long-term growth,\" the firm believes.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
