A Moneycontrol poll of seven brokerages had pegged the net profit at Rs 1,965 crore.However, the result hasn't been able to convince a host of brokerages as UBS, Macquarie and CLSA have issued bearish calls on the counter.Following the weak outlook, shares of Bajaj Auto slipped nosedived 4 percent to Rs 9,341.Follow our live blog for all the market updatesUBS has issued a 'sell' rating on the company with a target price of Rs 6,250, a downside of 35.5 percent.\u00a0The brokerage anticipates margin tailwinds to moderate ahead. They believe the market is assigning a 25x P/E ratio to Bajaj Auto's three-wheeler (3W) business while overlooking the muted response to the Triumph and the moderation in 3W volumes. Additionally, UBS notes that the market seems to be ignoring the slippage in Bajaj Auto's two-wheeler (2W) market share despite the launch of multiple new models.Read:\u00a0MFs expected to do the heavy lifting in upcoming QIPs of public sector banksMacquarie is 'neutral' on Bajaj Auto with a target price of Rs 9,655 per share. It said that multiple growth drivers are in play, including the introduction of CNG motorcycles and the expansion of their electric two-wheeler (E2W) portfolio with models priced under Rs 1 lakh. Additionally, Bajaj Auto is enhancing its manufacturing footprint in Latin America (LATAM) and ramping up volumes and distribution for electric three-wheelers (E3W) and premium motorcycles, which should provide further growth support, analysts said.Read more:\u00a0Infosys Q1 earnings: Five factors to watch forCLSA also retains its 'underperform' rating on the stock as it believes that valuations are expensive and await export recovery.

    "Despite affordable variants offered by the top four players, electric two-wheeler (E2W) sales remained flat during the first quarter (April-June) of the current financial year at 222,127 units, according to Vahan data.The total E2W registrations were marginally up by 1.62 percent from 218,574 units in the same period last year, the Vahan data showed.Industry players attributed the muted growth in numbers to the reduction in subsidies granted to EVs by the government by replacing the FAME2 Policy (valid till 31st March 2024) with the Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme (EMPS) 2024. The new scheme, which is valid from April 1 to July 31 this year, offers a maximum subsidy of Rs 10,000 per e-2W or Rs 5,000 per kWh of battery capacity, whichever is lower.According to ICRA, E2W volumes had improved to around 137,041 units in March 2024, aided by pre-buying ahead of reduction in subsidy from April 2024. Following the same, the volumes moderated in Q1 FY2025.As Rohan Kanwar Gupta, vice president & sector Head - Corporate ratings,\u00a0ICRA, \u201cThe moderation can be attributed to both reduction in subsidy benefits and to an extent also to the pre-buying which happened in March 2024.As per Vahan data, the total numbers of E2W sold during the months of April, May and June this year were 65,462 units, 77,160 units, and 79,505\u00a0 units, respectively.

    "Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Bajaj AutoWe met with the management of Bajaj Auto wherein the management gave a detailed overview of its 2W/3W/EV businesses. The management expects African volume to continue to be under pressure due to currency devaluation; however, the absence of African volume has been offset by a better mix in its international volume. Its Triumph launch has been well received in the US and UK, its key markets. The management aims to gradually scale up the production of Triumph to ~10k units/month (currently at ~6k units/month). The company launched E-3W in Q3FY24 in certain markets, where it has become one of the leading players aided by its strong brand value. Additionally, E-3W profitability is on par with ICE powertrain, while the path towards profitability for E-scooters will be gradual. BJAUT remains optimistic on its growth prospects, which will be led by a robust product portfolio for domestic and international markets. We foresee healthy demand from rural and urban markets driven by new launches across categories and strong presence in the 125+cc space. Positive demand momentum coupled with network expansion in E-3W/2W shall further aid in volume expansion. Factoring this, we estimate its revenue/EBITDA/APAT to grow at a CAGR of 13.8%/18.4%/16.7% over FY24- FY26E.OutlookGiven the high growth rate in E-scooters/3W, market share expansion and consistent mix improvement, we change our rating from \u2018Sell\u2019 to \u2018Hold\u2019 and revise our target price upwards to Rs9,984 valuing the company at 27x (20x earlier), factoring in the high growth rate in the EV and premium segments.For all recommendations report,\u00a0click hereDisclaimer:\u00a0The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.
