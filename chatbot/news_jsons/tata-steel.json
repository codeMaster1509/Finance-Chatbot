    "Tata Steel Netherlands will become debt-free in next 12-18 months, focusing on decarbonization capex and avoiding significant spending on the legacy business, managing director TV Narendran said in a call with analysts.Currently, Tata Steel UK and Tata Steel Netherlands each hold about GBP 600-800 million in debt, primarily for securitization and working capital requirement, Narendran\u00a0said.Tata Steel Netherlands was debt-free until about 12-15 months ago.Narendran said historically, the Netherlands had no debt due to positive cash flows, but recent challenges, including the repair and modernisation of the blast furnace, has led to the debt burden. However, this is not expected to be a long-term concern, he clarified.\u201cWe have around \u00a3200-300 million in old acquisition debt across the Netherlands, UK, and overseas acquisitions, excluding other bonds. The Netherlands is expected to use its cash flows to eliminate this debt within 12-18 months, as they won\u2019t have significant capex on the legacy business, with decarbonization spending being separate\u201d , TV Narendran said in the analyst concall.For the UK, Narendran said Tata Steel aims for EBITDA profitability and debt reduction, and\u00a0prepare for decarbonization. It has received \u00a3500 million in grants from the UK government to modernize the Port Talbot site.On 31 July, Tata Steel reported a 51 percent jump in consolidated net profit at Rs 960 crore for the quarter ended June. Revenue from operations declined 8 percent YoY to Rs 54,771 crore in Q1FY25.Tata Steel's European operations showed signs of recovery in the latest quarter, with the Netherlands' IJmuiden works benefiting from a new blast furnace. Despite overall weak demand in Europe, Tata Steel Netherlands' EBITDA turned positive at Rs 453 crore in June quarter.The EBITDA rebound was due to improved liquid steel production and stabilized operations. After issues with blast furnace 6, EBITDA reached GBP 43 million in the first quarter, reversing a GBP 27 million loss in the previous quarter. EBITDA per tonne improved by GBP 48 quarter-on-quarter, driven by reduced material costs and lower conversion costs, despite higher raw material expenses.However, the UK operations continued to struggle, posting a significant EBITDA loss of Rs 955 crore, with a higher loss per tonne compared to both the previous quarter and the same period last year. Increased inventory for downstream operations also impacted working capital, according to CFO Koushik Chatterjee.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "Metals major Tata Steel Ltd reported a 51 percent jump in consolidated net profit at Rs 960 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, from Rs 634 crore in the year-ago period.Here are the key highlights from the\u00a0first quarter results of Tata Steel:Q1 performance",
    "Tata Steel might need to pay\u00a0more than Rs 17,000 crore as minerals tax dues\u00a0to the state of Odisha, if the Supreme Court rules that\u00a0states can retrospectively impose taxes on mineral extraction,\u00a0the company said in an exchange filing on July 31.The disclosure comes a\u00a0 week after\u00a0a\u00a0nine-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court by a majority held that the royalty payable on minerals under the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 is not a tax.The SC bench said states have the power to impose tax and levies such as cess on land in which the mineral is extracted from.However, the company is awaiting\u00a0further clarity on the period of the tax levy\u2019s applicability to fully determine its financial obligations\u200b. The SC\u00a0on July 31 reserved its verdict on\u00a0whether its judgment holding that states have the power to impose tax on mineral extraction will be applicable prospectively or retrospectively.The steelmaker's battle with Odisha regarding the tax dates back to 2005, when\u00a0Odisha introduced \"Orissa Rural Infrastructure and Socio-Economic Development Act, 2004 (ORISED Act)\" with effect from February 01, 2005, levying tax on mineral bearing land.Tata Steel operates 10 mines in the eastern state which includes iron ore mines, chromite mines and manganese mines.\u00a0These mines play a crucial role in supplying raw materials for Tata Steel's operations in India.In December 2005, the High Court of Odisha ruled that the state lacked the authority to impose taxes on minerals, based on a writ petition filed by\u00a0Tata Steel. Later, Odisha contested this decision and appealed to the Supreme Court.\n       ",
    "Metals major Tata Steel Ltd reported 51 percent jump in consolidated net profit at Rs 960 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. It reported consolidated net profit of Rs\u00a0634 crore in the year-ago period.\u00a0The steelmaker's net profit missed analysts' expectations of Rs 1,025 crore, according to a poll by Moneycontrol, collated from estimates by ten brokerage houses. The net profit was also higher on a sequential basis, with the bottomline coming in at Rs 611.48 crore in the quarter ending March 31.The firm's revenue from operations declined 8 percent to Rs 54,771 crore in Q1FY25 as against Rs 59,490 crore in Q1FY24, with the topline also being lower over the Rs 58,687 crore reported in the Jan-Mar quarter. The consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation, or EBITDA, for the quarter was Rs 6,822 crore, higher by 11.4 percent on an annual basis, and also higher than the Rs 6,631 crore reported in Q4 FY24.The consolidated operating EBITDA margin for the quarter was around 12.5 percent, higher than the 10.3 percent reported in the same quarter last year, and the 11.3 percent reported in the Jan-Mar quarter, aided by a decline in the total expenses, at Rs 52,389 crore, lower than the Rs 58,553 crore for Q1 FY24, and Rs 56,497 crore in the preceding quarter. Raw material prices, including that of coking coal and iron ore, remained rangebound during the quarter, Tata Steel said in its investor presentation.Net debt at the end of the June quarter was Rs 82,162 crore., with the company's liquidity at Rs 36,460 crore.ELECTIONS, HEAT MAR INDIA OPSIn its India business, Tata Steel reported sluggish sales for the Apr-Jun quarter, which was marked by the General Elections, causing a slowdown in construction activity, as well as extreme heat in many parts of India, resulting in unavailability of labour and restrictions on construction. The company reported deliveries in India of 4.94 MT during the quarter, slightly higher over the same period last year, but declined 8.6 percent sequentially.Price growth, or the lack of it, in the company's India operations remained a drag on Tata Steel's balance sheet, as it has with other steelmakers too. Market sources indicate that prices of hot rolled coil steel have declined by around 5-6 percent on an annual basis, and have been largely flat sequentially. This resulted in Tata Steel's India operations reporting an EBITDA per tonne of Rs 14,227, lower than Rs 15,884 reported in the same quarter last year, and also representing a decline over Jan-Mar, when the same was Rs 15,282.The company noted that while imports \"witnessed moderation\" on a sequential basis, India remained a net importer of steel for the Apr-Jun quarter. Steelmakers, such as JSW Steel and others, have expressed concerns about the elevated levels of Chinese steel exports to India, which is also being routed through countries in the Association of South East Asian Nations, or ASEAN, trade bloc. India has a free trade agreement with ASEAN.NETHERLANDS RECOVERING, CHURN IN UKFor Tata Steel's long-struggling European operations, the reporting quarter was marked by a recovery in the company's mainland Europe business, primarily in The Netherlands, where a newly-refurbished blast furnace at its IJmuiden works has been up and running.Despite subdued demand in Europe, an improvement in cost metrics caused Tata Steel Netherlands to report a positive EBITDA of Rs 453 crore, translating to an EBITDA per tonne of Rs 3,075. In the quarter before and in the year-ago period, Tata Steel reported negative EBITDA from its Netherlands operations.For the company's UK operations, EBITDA remained in the red at Rs 955 crore, representing an EBITDA per tonne loss of Rs 14,076, significantly higher YoY and sequentially. The company also built up inventory to service its downstream operations, which impacted working capital, according to Koushik Chatterjee, Tata Steel executive director and chief financial officer.In Tata Steel UK, the company started its restructuring process to close its blast furnaces at Port Talbot and replace them with electric arc furnaces, even as parts of plan remain uncertain, particularly the 500 million pound support package that was to be provided by the UK government to the total 1.25 billion pound restructuring.The new UK government, led by the Labour Party prime minister Keir Starmer, has been critical of the layoffs that are expected as a result of the restructuring, and wants jobs to be protected before it starts disbursing the 500 million pounds. Around 2,800 people are expected to be laid off as part of the restructuring, with Tata Steel having commenced the process of closing its heavy-end assets, including one of the two blast furnaces. The other blast furnace is scheduled for closure in September.The company had previously indicated that the change in government would not get in the way of its restructuring plans in the UK. In the press release, ED and CFO Chatterjee said that it is continuing to engage with employees' unions in the UK, having opened the voluntary redundancy programme for employees on July 10, and it is also working with the UK government for the release of the 500 million pound grant.CAPEX AND EXPANSIONTata Steel spent Rs 3,777 crore\u00a0 by way of capital expenditure in Q1, with the 5 MTPA Kalinganagar expansion project being close to reallisation, according to the company.The firm's 3 MTPA facility in Kalinganagar is currently being expanded in capacity to 8 MTPA, with Tata Steel managing director and chief executive officer TV Narendran saying in a press release that the new blast facility there is expected to be commissioned by September 2024.The steelmaker announced that it is investing Rs 6,000 crore into its subsidiary Neelachal Ispat Nigam, which has a 1.1 MTPA integrated steel facility in Kalinganagar, Odisha. Tata Steel had previously said that it wants to proceed with a capacity expansion at Neelachal Ispat Nigam.On July 31, Tata Steel's shares on NSE closed trading 0.8 percent higher at Rs 165.44 apiece.\u00a0\n       ",

BDL has completed wave 4 and can start wave 5 on the higher side, which can take prices to the previous high near Rs 1,720 levels. We recommend a buy position with a stop-loss at Rs 1,380 (recent swing low) and target levels at Rs 1,720. The long-term trend is turning bullish, with the 20-day MA above the 50-day MA, providing additional upside momentum.Strategy: BuyTarget: Rs 1,550, Rs 1,720Stop-Loss: Rs 1,380Anshul Jain, Head of Research at Lakshmishree Investments & SecuritiesHindustan Unilever | CMP: Rs 2,735.3Hindustan Unilever (HUL) is showcasing a robust 150-week long Cup and Handle pattern on its weekly charts, with a critical neckline at Rs 2,680. During the base formation, volumes remained subdued, but the subsequent rally to the neckline has witnessed substantial volumes, indicating broad-based participation by smart money. Given the positive budget outlook for FMCG companies, HUL emerges as an attractive buy opportunity at Rs 2,750, with a stop-loss set below Rs 2,650 and an ambitious target of Rs 3,000+. The strong technical setup, coupled with favorable macroeconomic factors, positions HUL as a compelling choice for investors looking for growth in the FMCG sector. This setup highlights the stock's potential for significant upside in the coming months.Strategy: BuyTarget: Rs 3,000Stop-Loss: Rs 2,650Apex Frozen Foods | CMP: Rs 251.25The upcoming budget is anticipated to emphasize frozen food and logistics sectors, positioning Apex Frozen Foods as a significant beneficiary. Technically, Apex Frozen has formed a 68-week-long Double Bottom pattern with the right bottom emerging on extremely dried-up volumes, indicating strong accumulation. This pattern typically suggests a reversal and a potential uptrend. The stock presents an attractive buy opportunity at the current market price of Rs 251, with an immediate stop-loss on a close below Rs 220. With the budget likely to focus on these sectors, Apex Frozen Foods could see a substantial upside, targeting Rs 345. Investors should keep an eye on this stock for a promising breakout in the near term.Strategy: BuyTarget: Rs 345Stop-Loss: Rs 220Snowman Logistics | CMP: Rs 74.37The upcoming budget is anticipated to heavily emphasize the logistics sector, making Snowman Logistics a standout contender for potential gains. Snowman Logistics is displaying exceptional technical strength, with a 19-week-long Cup and Handle pattern forming on the weekly charts. This classic bullish pattern is backed by volume dynamics\u2014volumes remained subdued during the Cup formation but surged significantly as the stock approached the Handle's neckline. This suggests strong buying interest and accumulation. Given the stock's current market price of Rs 74, investors can consider buying with a stop-loss at Rs 65 and a target of Rs 90. With the expected budget boost to logistics, Snowman Logistics is well-positioned for substantial returns.Strategy: BuyTarget: Rs 90Stop-Loss: Rs 65Navkar Corporation | CMP: Rs 137.58The upcoming budget is expected to be highly favourable for Navkar Corporation, and the stock's technicals are aligning perfectly with this outlook. Navkar Corp has broken out of a bullish 25-week-long Cup and Handle pattern on the weekly chart, which is a classic indicator of a strong upward trend. The breakout has been accompanied by significant follow-through on substantial volumes, reinforcing the bullish sentiment. This volume surge during the breakout phase signals robust buying interest and institutional accumulation. Currently trading at Rs 137.58, Navkar Corp presents a compelling buy opportunity with a stop-loss below Rs 115. The immediate target for this trade setup is Rs 225, making it a potential high-reward investment in light of the positive budget expectations.Strategy: BuyTarget: Rs 225Stop-Loss: Rs 115Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research at Anand RathiTata Steel | CMP: Rs 160.32Recently, Tata Steel experienced a significant decline, dropping nearly 22 rupees after forming a Double Top at Rs 180 level. This decline equates to a 12 percent fall, reflecting considerable selling pressure. However, the stock found support around its 150-day Exponential Moving Average (DEMA), indicating a potential stabilization point. On the indicator front, the daily Relative Strength Index (RSI) has formed an impulsive structure near the 30 oversold zone, which appears attractive at current levels. Therefore, we advise buying Tata Steel in the Rs 158-162 zone, with a target of Rs 175 and a stop-loss of Rs 153 on a daily close basis.Strategy: BuyTarget: Rs 175Stop-Loss: Rs 153Chemplast Sanmar | CMP: Rs 528.85Recently, Chemplast Sanmar has been in a corrective phase. However, in the previous trading session, it found support at its previous breakout upper band, accompanied by significant volume. Additionally, the daily RSI has reversed from the 50 level on a daily scale, further affirming our bullish stance on the stock. Therefore, we recommend going long in the Rs 520-530 zone, with a target of Rs 600 and a stop-loss placed near Rs 488 on a daily close basis.Strategy: BuyTarget: Rs 600Stop-Loss: Rs 488Hikal | CMP: Rs 342.55During the past few weeks, Hikal has been in a corrective phase, experiencing a downward adjustment in its price. However, in the previous trading session, the stock found support at the upper band of its previous breakout level, a crucial technical indicator suggesting potential stabilization. This support was further validated by the formation of a Bullish Piercing candlestick pattern, a reliable signal of a possible trend reversal. Additionally, the daily RSI, a momentum oscillator, has reversed from the 50 level on a daily scale, indicating renewed buying interest and further affirming our bullish outlook on the stock. Given these technical indicators, we recommend initiating a long position in the Rs 335-345 zone, with an upside target of Rs 390 and a stop-loss set at Rs 315 on a daily close basis to manage risk.Strategy: BuyTarget: Rs 390Stop-Loss: Rs 315Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "Tata Steel's strategy for its UK plants remains unchanged even though a new government has come to power, chairman N Chandrasekaran told shareholders on July 15 at the annual general meeting. His words indicated that the steelmaker will\u00a0march ahead with its plans to close the second blast furnace plant, which would result in the loss of 2,800 jobs in Port Talbot, Wales.\"I must say we have had very good discussions with both the previous government and the current government. We have been working very closely with the government, the unions and the local government in Wales... everybody is working together to make sure the project is on track and we don't see any change in direction,\" Chandrasekaran said when some of the investors raised queries on the transition plans in UK post-elections.The comments come amid reports that the change in government in the United Kingdom could hinder Tata Steel's plans to reduce jobs as part of its strategy to shut down the aging blast furnaces.Last week, Fitch Ratings changed its outlook on Tata Steel to negative due\u00a0to uncertainties surrounding the company's efforts to improve operations in the UK.\"We are constantly looking at how we can not only deliver to our downstream product commitments, but also any other expansion opportunities with the right financial metrics... so that we are able to serve the market, customers and also keep employment,\" Chandrasekaran added.According to a few UK media reports, the UK government's new business secretary Jonathan Reynolds has said that \"job guarantees\" will form part of the negotiations with Tata Steel.Reynolds said there was \"a better deal available\" on the future of the plant, but said newer technologies would employ fewer people, according to a BBC report from last week.Tata Steel operates a 3 million tonne per annum (MTPA) plant at Port Talbot in South Wales, employing approximately 8,000 people across its operations in the country. As part of its decarbonization strategy, the company is transitioning from the blast furnace (BF) method, which is approaching the end of its life cycle, to a low-emission electric arc furnace (EAF) process.In September 2023, Tata Steel and the UK government agreed on a joint investment of \u00a31.25 billion to implement decarbonization initiatives at the Port Talbot steelmaking facility in Britain.\n       ",
    "Fitch Ratings on Friday revised its outlook on domestic steel major Tata Steel to negative on account of uncertainty surrounding the turnaround of the company's operations in the UK.However, the expected robust growth in Tata Steel's India operations and likely earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) profits at Dutch operations in FY25, may offset any losses at UK operations, Fitch Ratings said in a report.\"Fitch Ratings has revised the Outlook on India-based Tata Steel Limited's (TSL) Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to Negative, from Stable, and affirmed the IDR at 'BBB-'.\"We have also affirmed the rating on the USD 1 billion notes due July 2024 issued by TSL's subsidiary ABJA Investment Co. Pte. Ltd. and guaranteed by TSL, at 'BBB-',\" the statement said, adding that the negative outlook reflects uncertainty surrounding turnaround of the UK operations.The rating agency further said that the change in the UK government and labour union's actions to save job losses at TSL's UK operations may delay its plan to reduce losses through FY25.Tata Steel owns 3 million tonne per annum (MTPA) at Port Talbot plant in South Wales and employs around 8,000 people across all its operations in that country.As part of its decarbonisation plan, the company is shifting to a low-emission electric arc furnace (EAF) process from the blast furnace (BF) route which is nearing its end of life cycle.In September 2023, Tata Steel and the UK government agreed on a joint investment plan of 1.25 billion pounds to execute decarbonisation plans at Port Talbot steel making facility in Britain.Of the 1.25 billion pounds, 500 million pounds was provided by the UK government.\n       ",
    "Amid concerns over global economic uncertainty, operational aspects, and rising steel imports from China, analysts slashed their ratings and target prices for\u00a0Tata Steel.The\u00a0Tata group-led firm\u00a0was\u00a0one of the most downgraded stocks on the Street over the past year, past quarter and past month.From 26 'buy' calls last year, only 14 brokerages have maintained their bullish rating on the player. Tata Steel went from four 'hold' and three 'sell' ratings to nine 'hold' and eight 'sell' calls in a year.According to experts, the onset of monsoon across the country will limit and restrict construction-led activity, impacting the demand for steel and prevent any major upward movement in prices during the near-term.\"Additionally, flat steel prices may face pressure as imports of flat steel are likely to increase. On the cost front, rising coking coal prices are likely to drag margin of steel firms in the medium term,\" said Elara Securities.China imports riseOn the domestic front, steel spreads are falling as Chinese steel production rises. The exports from China are depressing the global prices. Steel exports from China have fallen by $25/tonne over the past quarter.\"In the foreseeable future, the steel market will likely experience sustained downward pressure, resulting in no improvement in steel spreads,\" per InCred Equities. The brokerage has a 'sell' rating on Tata Steel.On the other hand,\u00a0Jefferies upheld its \"buy\" ratings on Tata Steel and the target price has been increased to Rs 200. Jefferies was positive on\u00a0the notable rise in manufacturing activities reported by China and the United States. With these two countries being major consumers of metal, an increase in manufacturing activity would translate to a heightened demand for metal.Also Read |\u00a0UK's Unite union suspends strike at Tata Steel plantUK plant closureTata Steel plans to invest $2.1 billion into its Singapore arm\u00a0will help repay the existing debt of its offshore entities and support rejig costs in the UK.Morgan Stanley noted that Tata Steel's heavy assets in the UK are close to shutting down. This could mean a change in the company's strategy, possibly leading to reallocating resources or new investments.The closures were announced in January as part of the Indian company's plan to turn around its loss-making UK business by switching to lower carbon electric arc furnaces, a proposal backed by 500 million pounds ($632 million) of government money.The steelmaker has begun preparations to place equipment orders for the electric arc furnace by September 2024, begin enabling and preparatory works at the site by December 2024, and based on current permitting timelines, begin construction on the project by August 2025.However, the plant closure plans have been met with controversy as workers threatened to go on a strike\u00a0due to the potential job losses.Profit fallsOn May 29, Tata Steel reported 64 percent fall in fourth quarter profit (attributable to owners) at Rs\u00a0611.48 crore, amid lower steel realisations and poor performance in the steelmaker's international operations for the quarter ended March. The company had reported net profit of Rs\u00a01,704.86 crore in the same\u00a0 quarter\u00a0a year ago.The consolidated revenue from operations\u00a0for the quarter fell 6.7 percent to Rs\u00a058,687.3 crore as compared to Rs\u00a062,961.5 crore recorded in the year-ago period.The loss was significantly higher than anticipated, leading to concerns among analysts about the company's operational challenges and prompting downward revisions.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "Tata Steel aims at having a minimum of 25 per cent of its workforce made up of diverse groups, including gender minorities, marginalised communities, persons with disabilities and LGBTQIA+ individuals, within the next few years, a company official said.It is one of the first companies in the country to roll out a special recruitment drive for transgender talent, having recruited over 100 members from the community for various roles across different locations, the official claimed.\"Continuing this drive, we aim to have 25 per cent of our workforce from diverse groups in the next couple of years,\" the official said.A total of 113 transgender individuals have been onboarded and posted at various locations, including manufacturing, operations and maintenance, mining, and services. These employees are stationed in Noamundi, West Bokaro, Kolkata, Kharagpur, Kalinganagar, and Jamshedpur.Some of these employees work all three shifts and operate Heavy Earth Moving Machinery (HEMM) at the Noamundi iron ore mine in Jharkhand's West Singhbhum and West Bokaro coal mine in Ramgarh district.\"Tata Steel appreciates the potential of diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) and has a tremendous organisational focus on it,\" the official said.\"In line with this, we renewed our commitment and refocused our approach to DE&I in 2015 by setting up MOSAIC - a platform for pioneering initiatives, diversity targets, and employee-friendly policies conceptualised and executed from the apex level,\" he added.The official admitted that the initial planning stage was challenging due to inadequate knowledge about the transgender community.\"However, we made a detailed plan and implemented it without any difficulty. To date, we have not received any complaint from either side of the employees since the first batch of transgender individuals was inducted following proper training in 2019,\" the official said.On the productivity of these employees compared to the general workforce, he said transgender individuals perform better in some areas.Jaya Singh Panda, Chief Diversity Officer at Tata Steel, said, \"We believe in nurturing a workplace where every person, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity, feels valued, respected, and empowered. Diversity is one of our greatest strengths, and continuing this practice is key to long-term success and innovation.\"Speaking on condition of anonymity, a transgender employee at the company's Jamshedpur plant said, \"We feel very safe inside the company as coworkers are friendly, supportive, and cooperative. The company has also developed infrastructure, including separate toilets for us.\" Another trans-female employee from Noamundi lamented that her parents never used to care about whether she ate or came home on time.\"When my father learned about my job at Tata Steel, he did not believe me. He came and stayed with me until I joined. Since then, he calls me every day to check on me,\" the worker said.A trans-male employee in Jamshedpur said his job at the company enabled him to support his family and help with his sister's marriage, something he never imagined possible.Another trans-female employee in Jamshedpur expressed gratitude for the accommodation provided by the company.\"I'm happy that my society has accepted me as an individual,\" another member of the group added.\n       ",
    "Around 1,500 Tata Steel workers in Britain will begin an indefinite strike from July 8 over the company's plans to close two blast furnaces and cut up to 2,800 jobs, the trade union Unite said on June 21.The strike action, described by Unite as the first strikes by British steel workers in 40 years, will take place at Tata's Port Talbot and Llanwern sites in Wales.The closures were announced in January as part of the Indian company's plan to turn around its loss-making UK business by switching to lower carbon electric arc furnaces, a proposal backed by 500 million pounds ($632 million) of government money.\"Tata\u2019s workers are not just fighting for their jobs - they are fighting for the future of their communities and the future of steel in Wales,\" Unite General Secretary Sharon Graham said.Tata Steel employs more than 8,000 people in the UK. The company said in January about about 2,500 jobs of the total being cut were likely to go over the next 18 months.Reacting to the strike decision by the union, a Tata Steel spokesperson said: \"We are extremely disappointed by Unite\u2019s unilateral decision to call strike action. Our existing steelmaking assets are near the end of their life, are operationally unstable and causing unsustainable losses of \u00a31 million a day. This is why preparations to close the blast furnaces and associated plants in Port Talbot are unchanged.\"\u201cHowever, if the safety and stability of our operations are put at risk by this action, we will be forced to accelerate those closure plans. After extensive negotiations with our unions we substantially improved our support offering for affected employees \u2013 the most generous package in our history. Rather than taking strike action, we would have expected Unite to put our improved offer to its members, as previously accepted by all unions, including Unite,\" the\u00a0spokesperson added.(With Reuters inputs) ",
    "S&P Global Ratings on June 14 placed its ratings on six Tata group entities, including Tata Motors, Tata Steel and Tata Power on CreditWatch with positive implications. The other companies in the Tata Group are Jaguar Land Rover, Tata Power, TML Holdings and ABJA Investment.The rating actions come ahead of S&P's review of the relationship between the group's holding company, Tata Sons and its subsidiaries. The review will assess whether the potential of extraordinary support for the group entities from Tata Sons is greater than what we previously factored, S&P said in a statement. This is due to increasing operational and management linkages within the group.S&P noted that Tata Sons has a record of supporting group entities in events of stress. For example, the group provided material extraordinary financial support to entities such as Tata Teleservices Ltd. and Coastal Gujarat Power Ltd., an erstwhile subsidiary of Tata Power, which has now been merged with Tata Power.\"We are also undertaking the review because we believe operational integration between Tata Sons and group entities, as well as between group entities, will continue to increase.\"In addition, we note the continued close involvement of Tata Sons in the strategies of group entities. For example, the holding company led negotiations with the U.K. government for setting up the battery plant and securing government support for the restructuring of Tata Steel's U.K. facility.Tata Sons has a clear imprint on the group's financial strategy, in line with a groupwide focus on managing leverage, the ratings agency noted.\n       ",

    "Tata Steel has expressed concerns over news reports in the UK media suggesting that the investment and restructuring programme at Port Talbot may be 'put in peril' over differences between Conservative and Labour parties in the ongoing election period.In a statement to stock exchanges on June 11, Tata Steel clarified that it would continue with its announced closure of assets and restructuring program at the plant in the coming months. \"We urge and request the current and the incoming government post-elections, to adhere to and safeguard the agreed terms of the \u00a3500 million package of support for the Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) project announced in September 2023\", Tata Steel said in the statement.As of now, one blast furnace at Port Talbot is scheduled to close by the end of June, and another one by the end of September, the company said. The plant plans to continue to service customers by utilising imported, semi-finished steel till the new furnace is built and commissioned.The Labour party has called for Tata Steel to make 'no irreversible decisions' till the General Election next month, said news reports. The First Minister of Wales and leader of Welsh Labour Vaughan Gething has met the management and trade unions at Port Talbot on June 10 and is making efforts to keep steelmaking going at the plant.Labour Party's shadow Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds has urged Tata Steel to wait till the general election and hold new talks, BBC reported on June 10. Reynolds has promised more government funds than the \u00a3500 million which were promised by the Conservatives.Tata Steel is one of UK\u2019s biggest private investors, and its GBP 1.25 billion investment in Port Talbot is the largest in many decades in British steelmaking.In April this year, Tata Steel had decided to shut its furnaces at Port Talbot, turning down union's plea to reconsider the plans, stating daily financial loss of GBP 1 million due to the operations. Construction work on a new furnace at Port Talbot is likely to begin next year, one that would employ fewer workers and would adhere to greener production.\n       ",

    "Tata Steel has said it is premature to draw final conclusions following reports that the Dutch parliament approved providing an unspecified amount of subsidies to the company for the green transformation of its plant in the Netherlands.The proposed terms would require approval from both the Netherlands parliament and the Tata Steel board, the company said in an exchange filing on June 6.Given the ongoing nature of the discussions and negotiations, it was not in a position to comment further on the news reports circulating in the mainstream media, the company said.Bloomberg has reported that the Netherlands may pay up to \u20ac3 billion for the green transformation of Tata Steel's IJmuiden factory to address health and environmental concerns in the surrounding area.On June 5, the Dutch parliament formally mandated the government to negotiate terms of potential support for decarbonisation efforts in Tata Steel Nederland, the report said.Tata Steel said discussions with the Dutch government on decarbonisation had been ongoing since March.As part of the negotiations, the Dutch government has formulated a detailed framework involving diligence, analysis, discussions, and negotiations with Tata Steel. This process is expected to take several months before potentially culminating in an agreed set of terms, the reports said.Tata Steel reaffirmed its commitment to complying with disclosure obligations and making accurate and timely disclosures as required by regulations.At 10.22 am, the Tata Steel stock was trading at Rs173.35 on the National Stock Exchange, up 2.45 percent from the previous close.\n       ",
    "The Netherlands may pay up to $3.26 billion for the green transformation of Tata Steel Ltd.\u2019s IJmuiden factory, which has caused serious health and environmental problems in the surrounding area, reported Bloomberg on June 5.On Wednesday, the steelmaker's shares were trading 6.6 percent higher at Rs 169.45 apiece.On June 4, the Dutch parliament approved providing an unspecified amount of subsidies to the company to accelerate the renovation. External consultants estimate subsidies could reach $3.26 billion, according to a spokesperson for the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate, reported Bloomberg.People living close to Tata Steel\u2019s Dutch steelworks have a life expectancy that is 2.5 months lower than the average for the Netherlands due to the plant\u2019s emissions, the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment said last year, reported Reuters.The Institute said its research showed that exposure to particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide increases the risk of lung cancer and that 4% of the new cases in the area could be attributed to the emissions from the plant.The research also showed that 3% of new cases of asthma in children were due to the emissions.Negotiations with Tata Steel to reach an agreement on the funding have started, but the process is confidential and the ministry can\u2019t comment on the financial size of the subsidy yet, the ministry spokesperson said, reported Bloomberg on June 5.Tata is \u201cpleased with the broad support\u201d from the Dutch parliament to make the steelworks more sustainable, according to Tata Steel spokesman Peter van Boesschoten.\u201cApart from the money we will put in our Green Steel plan ourselves, we will need government support, just like our competitors in Germany, Belgium and France, to establish a European level playing field as much as possible,\u201d Van Boesschoten said.\n       "
