    "It appears that the week ended February 9 was characterised by significant volatility, with the India VIX reading again surpassing 15 and closing near 15.5 on a weekly scale. This suggests that market participants should brace for potentially heightened volatility in the week beginning February 12.Regarding the Nifty index, despite attempting to break the all-time high of around 22,126.80, the index failed to do so and reversed from approximately 22,053, closing below the 21,800 mark with a weekly loss of around 0.33 percent. This indicates some resistance at the all-time high level.Looking ahead to the current week, it's crucial for traders to closely monitor the 21,500 level, which is identified as a significant support level. A breach of this level could potentially trigger panic in the market.On the upside, if the Nifty index manages to sustain above 21,700, there's a possibility of it retesting the 22,000\u201322,100 levels. This suggests that traders should keep a close eye on the key support and resistance levels and remain flexible in their trading strategies.Bank NiftyIt seems that despite a significant rebound from the 200-day exponential moving average (DEMA), the Bank Nifty closed the week with a -0.73 percent loss, indicating some selling pressure. However, observing a bullish Bat pattern on a daily scale, suggesting potential upward momentum in the near term.The Bank Nifty needs to hold the support of 45,000 in the current week. If the index manages to sustain above 45,000, there's a possibility of it testing the 46,500 level, indicating further bullish movement.Conversely, a failure to maintain support at 45,000 could lead to additional selling pressure, potentially pushing the Bank Nifty down to the next support level of 44,500. The presence of a bullish trendline from the October 26, 2023, low of 42,800 further supports the idea of a potential upward trend in the Bank Nifty.Here are three buy calls for short term:Dr Reddy's Laboratories: Buy | LTP: Rs 6,156 | Stop-Loss: Rs 5,850 | Target: Rs 6,675 | Return: 8 percentThe past few months have been good for the pharma stocks since the index Nifty Pharma surged over 20 percent from the bottom of 14,600. Although most of the heavyweight pharma participated in this rally but Dr Reddy's Labs was consolidating since many weeks.Finally, the stock has now confirmed a breakout which resembles a bullish Cup and Handle pattern. Thus, traders are advised to buy the stock in the range of Rs 6,100-6,200 with a stop-loss of Rs 5,850 on closing basis for an upside target of Rs 6,675Aether Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 866 | Stop-Loss: Rs 810 | Target: Rs 975 | Return: 13 percentSince a month or so, the said counter has gained massive momentum from the retracement levels of its previous up move (0.786 percent), thus making it a lucrative buy. Having said that, time and price retracement are falling at the same length, which is a strong indication of bottoming out. (Time retracement is 0.382 percent and price retracement is 0.786 percent).On the indicator front, the weekly RSI (relative strength index) has formed an impulsive structure near 30 levels, which further confirms our bullish stance on the counter. Thus, one can buy in the zone of Rs 855-870 for a target of Rs 975 and a stop-loss of Rs 810 on a daily closing basis.RAIN Industries: Buy | LTP: Rs 184 | Stop-Loss: Rs 160 | Target: Rs 220 | Return: 20 percentSince the last 2 months or so, the said counter has been consolidating between Rs 145 and Rs 155. Recently, it has given a breakout from the said range on a weekly closing basis, which is looking lucrative. Having said that, it has also formed a bullish GARTLEY pattern, which is 1.38 years old, thus making it more reliable.Also, it has violated a couple of trendlines. The best part about this bullish reversal is that every bottom has bought with huge volume bars, which indicates bullish bias in the counter.On the indicator front, the weekly RSI (relative strength index) has given a trendline violation, which further affirms our bullish stance on the counter. Thus, we advised traders and investors to go long in the range of Rs 175-185 with an upside target of Rs 220, and the stop-loss would be placed at Rs 160 on a daily close basis.Note: The Gartley pattern is a harmonic chart pattern, based on Fibonacci numbers and ratios, which help traders, identify reaction highs and lowsDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "Drugmaker Dr Reddy's Laboratories is expected to report marginal on-year growth in its revenue and a low double-digit increase in net profit for the October-December quarter. The pharmaceutical company is slated to release its third quarter (Q3) earnings on January 30.The drugmaker is expected to report a net profit of around Rs 1,383 crore, up 12 percent from Rs 1,237.90 crore recorded in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year, according to an average of estimates of nine brokerages.Revenue is expected to record a marginal 4 percent on-year rise to Rs 7,030.90 crore, dragged by weak sales from the domestic market and price erosion in other key products in the US. However, the contribution from the blockbuster cancer drug Revlimid is expected to remain stable, offsetting the loss of revenue from other segments.The pharma major had posted a topline of Rs 6,789.80 crore in the year-ago period.Among the brokerage estimates collated by Moneycontrol, JM Financial rolled out the most bearish growth projections for Dr Reddy's Q3 performance, while YES Securities was the most optimistic.Revlimid contribution remains steady, others not so muchThe generic version of the cancer drug Revlimid will continue to remain the star contributor to the drugmaker's US revenue for yet another quarter, with analysts estimating its contribution to come to around $100 million for Q3. However, lower sales of Ciprodex (used to treat ear infections) due to an unfavourable seasonality effect and Suboxone (used to treat opioid addiction) due to high price erosion are likely to weigh on the overall revenue growth in the US business.Also Read |\u00a0Cipla shares rally 8% to hit 52-week high on strong Q3 earningsStill, JM Financial believes that a ramp-up of the company's recently acquired Mayne portfolio should support incremental growth in the drugmaker's base business in the US to reach $279 million in Q3.Tepid domestic growth may spoil moodThe company's India business is likely to report mid-single-digit on-year growth in Q3, adversely impacted by a sporadic acute season during the quarter. Brokerage firm Nuvama Institutional Equities predicts a mere 7 percent on-year growth in Dr Reddy's India business due to a weak acute season and lost sales from divested brands.Dr Reddy's had divested nine dermatology brands to Eris Lifesciences in the last quarter of FY23.Margins to remain stableWith a sustained contribution from the high-margin Revlimid, analysts expect Dr Reddy's operating margin in Q3 to remain stable year-on-year (YoY). On that account, Kotak Institutional Equities pegged 2 percent on-year growth in the company's consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) at Rs 2,100 crore, with the EBITDA margin expanding 20 basis points (bps) sequentially to 29.1 percent.Going ahead, brokerages also believe that the drugmaker's commentary on its US base business and margin trend will remain the key monitorable, especially at a time when the contribution from Revlimid is expected to gradually taper off through the coming fiscal.Also Read |\u00a0Cipla tumbles 3% after Samina Hamied steps down as VCDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

If the Nifty 50 gives a strong closing above 21,500, then there is a possibility of upward trend towards 21,700, with support at 21,300-21,200 area, they said.On January 25, the Nifty 50 rallied 215 points to 21,454, and formed a long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts, while the BSE Sensex was up 690 points at 71,060. The Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices also participated in the run, rising 1.8 percent and 1.7 percent.Stocks that performed better than the benchmark indices and broader markets included Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail, Dr Reddy's Laboratories, and Borosil Renewables.

Also, the correction from the recent top Rs 248 had very thin volume, which hints that bears are losing steam. In previous trading sessions, the said counter has gained momentum, which is looking lucrative.On indicator, hourly scale stochastics has managed to make bullish divergence, which further confirms the bullish stance in the counter. Thus, we advise going long in the range of Rs 230\u2013238 with an upside target of Rs 265 and a stop-loss placed near Rs 219 on a daily close basis.Dr Reddy's LaboratoriesSince the last few months, the counter has been respecting Rs 5,500 levels. Also, the correction from the recent top Rs 5,970 had very thin volume (refer to the chart), which hints that bears are losing steam.In previous trading sessions, the said counter has gained momentum by clocking 4 percent gains, which is looking lucrative. On indicator, daily scale stochastics has managed to make bullish hidden divergence, which further confirms the bullish stance in the counter. Thus, we advise going long in the range of Rs 5,850-6,000 with an upside target of Rs 6,350 and a stop-loss placed near Rs 5,699 on a daily close basis.Note: Hidden Bullish Divergence is Once price makes a higher low (HL), look and see if the oscillator (stochastics in our case) does the same. If it doesn\u2019t and makes a lower low (LL), then we\u2019ve got some hidden divergence in our hands.Borosil RenewablesJanuary 2024 has been fabulous for the said counter as it has already given 38 percent return in just one month time. Having said that still lot of upside potential is seen. On monthly time frame it has taken out previous 7 months candle. Also, volume is very huge from lower levels which is making it as a lucrative buy.On Indicator front, monthly stochastics has given bull cross just above oversold zone which further confirms bullish stance in the counter. Thus, one can buy in small tranche in the range of Rs 590-615 and another tranche in the range of Rs 550-560 (if tested) for upside target of Rs 750 and stop-loss would be placed near Rs 499 on daily close basis.

    "Pharmaceutical major Dr Reddy\u2019s Laboratories delivered better-than-expected Q2 results, backed by strong contribution from the blockbuster cancer drug Revlimid and higher other income from benefits from the government's production-linked incentives.However, brokerages see the drugmaker's high dependence on Revlimid, increased focus on inorganic growth and expensive valuations\u00a0as major headwinds for Dr Reddy's.Brokerage firm Noumra attributed Dr Reddy's better-than-expected Q2 results to higher non-recurring income due to a litigation settlement income of Rs 98.4 crore, higher grants from the PLI scheme (at Rs 160 crore against a quarterly average of Rs 75 crore) along with better US revenues, thanks to\u00a0resilient\u00a0Revlimid sales. Nomura has a 'neutral' call on the drugmaker with a target price of Rs 5,802.Dr Reddy's reported its highest-ever net profit and revenue in Q2 at Rs 1,480 crore and\u00a0\u00a0Rs 6,880.20 crore.\u00a0Not just that, both the\u00a0net profit as well as\u00a0revenue also topped the Street's expectations of Rs 1,290.7 crore and Rs 6,830.2 crore.\u00a0EBITDA margin also expanded to 31.7 percent in July-September as against 30.6 percent in the base period.However, much of the company's strong profitability in Q2 was on account of sales of high-margin Revlimid. \"Excluding it, margins are subpar at 20 percent. We identify\u00a0the reserves that Revlimid can generate to fund inorganic growth and R&D, but that also exposes it to margin and return risks post-Revlimid,\" Nuvama Institutional Equities mentioned in a note.The drugmaker is also extensively exploring opportunities of inorganic growth to compensate for the loss of Revlimid contribution from FY26. But Nuvama believes that it might not be\u00a0a smooth sail as Dr Reddy's\u00a0core business remains under threat and runs the risk of returns tapering down.On that account, Nuvama has a 'reduce' call on Dr Reddy's with a price target of Rs\u00a04,670.Follow our live blog for all the market actionInvestec also believes that increased investments depressed Dr Reddy's near-term EPS, excluding Revlimid. On the other side, Investec also sees the company generating significant cash flow from Revlimid sales which helps it to evaluate better inorganic opportunities that could possibly lead to higher growth in the long run. The brokerage has a 'buy' call on Dr Reddy's with a target price of Rs\u00a06,520.Motilal Oswal Finacial Services also highlighted expectations of an earnings growth moderation for Dr Reddy's after a strong 31 percent earnings CAGR over FY21-23. \"We expect earnings growth momentum to moderate to 12 percent CAGR over FY23-25 due to the high base on account of Revlimid and gradual recovery in Emerging Markets/Pharmaceutical services sales,\" MOFSL said in a note.MOFSL also feels that the current stock\u00a0valuation adequately factors any earnings upside for Dr Reddy's.

    "Pharmaceutical major Dr Reddy's Laboratories is expected to report a healthy jump in net profit on the back of a decent sales growth when it announce its July-September quarter earnings on October 27.The Hyderabad-based company's revenue is expected to see high single-digit on-year growth as it continues to benefit from the robust sales of the blockbuster cancer drug Revlimid in the US.According to a poll of brokerages collated by Moneycontrol, Dr Reddy\u2019s is likely to report a net profit of Rs 1,481.80 crore, up 34.7 percent from a year ago. Its revenue is expected to be at Rs 6,945.10 crore, rising 9.6 percent from the same quarter of the previous fiscal.Sequential, Dr Reddy\u2019s is likely to see a cooling of Revlimid sales and weakness in the domestic market. The company delivered a topline of Rs 6,757.90 crore and a bottomline of Rs 1,400.70 crore in the previous quarter.US growth to hold up in Q2Growth in Dr Reddy's US business is expected to remain resilient as sales Revlimid remain strong when compared to peers despite some moderation. A ramp-up of Nuvaring, a contraception ring, constipation drug Amitiza, Suboxone, which is used to treat opioid use disorder, Vascepa that reduces the risk of heart attack and stroke and Remoduli, which is for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension, will also aid US sales.Brokerage firm Philip Capital has forecast strong US sales for Dr Reddy's at $355 million, led by the continued benefit of Revlimid, pegged at nearly $100 million, and integration of acquired Mayne Pharma's operation with sales of over $25 million.India business weak\u00a0A slowdown in the domestic pharma market due lower offtake in acute sales on the back of a sporadic monsoon and slower uptick in viral infections is likely to weigh down Dr Reddy's growth in the domestic market.Brokerage firm Nuvama Institutional Equities sees Dr Reddy's India business delivering a mere 5 percent growth on-year due to a season of weak so-called acute season as well as lost sales from divested brands.Acute therapies are anti-infective drugs but because monsoon was sporadic and late this year, these infections didn't see a spike, impacting sale of acute drugs.Other markets like Europe and Russia are expected to deliver double-digit growth in Q2.Pressure on margins likelyThe moderation in sales of high-margin drug Revlimid and a change in product mix is expected to be a major drag on Dr Reddy's profitability sequentially.According to Kotak Institutional Equities, a sequential decline of 80 basis points (bps) in gross margins and 220 (bps) in the EBITDA margin is likely . The firm also expects consolidated EBITDA to grow 3 percent on year to Rs 1,950 crore.EBITDA is short for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation.\u00a0One basis points\u00a0is one-hundredth of a\u00a0percentage point.Aside from the earnings show, stakeholders will also be watching the management's commentary on margins and US sales excluding those of Revlimid.

    "The market resumed selling pressure after a day of rebound and fell below the 19,700 mark, which coincides with the 20-day EMA (exponential moving average), on October 18. Hence, if the correction persists and index decisively breaks the 50-day EMA of 19,600, which is expected to be the immediate support for the index in the next session, then 19,480, the low of the previous week, can't be ruled out, while 19,750-19,850 will remain hurdle for the index on higher side, experts said.The Nifty50 dropped 140 points to 19,671, and the BSE Sensex slipped more than 550 points to 65,877, while the breadth was in favour of bears in the 1:2 ratio.The broader markets were also supported by bears, as the Nifty Midcap 100 was down 0.9 percent and Smallcap 100 index fell third of a percent.Stocks that outperformed the broader markets included Dr Reddy's Laboratories, KPR Mill, and Sun TV Network. Dr Reddy's Laboratories has seen a breakout of falling resistance trendline on Wednesday after a consolidation and formed a long, bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts with above average volumes. The stock gained 2.4 percent to Rs 5,677.5 and traded above all key moving averages (20, 50, 100 and 200-day EMAs), which is a positive sign.KPR Mill ended at a record closing high of Rs 820.3, up 3.4 percent with robust volumes. The stock has formed long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts, continuing uptrend of the last four sessions. The stock has taken a good support at 50-day EMA in the recent correction and got back decisively above the 20-day EMA in the current uptrend. It gained more momentum after breakout of falling resistance trendline in previous session.Sun TV Network traded at multi-year highs now, rising 3 percent to Rs 661.8, the highest closing level since November 1, 2018. The stock has formed long bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts, with strong volumes, while on weekly scale, it has given horizontal resistance trendline breakout this week with above average volumes.Here's what Jigar S Patel of Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:Dr Reddy's LaboratoriesSince the last 8\u201310 trading sessions, the said counter has been trading in the tight range (consolidating) of Rs 5,400\u20135,600. In the previous trading session, it took out the said range and is currently placed near Rs 5,700 mark.The best part about this consolidation is that it consolidated near 50 DEMA (the daily exponential moving average). On the indicator front, daily DMI\u2019s (directional movement index) have turned positive, and the RSI (relative strength index) daily has reversed from 40 levels, which is looking lucrative.One can buy in the range of Rs 5,650\u20135,700, with a stop-loss of Rs 5,480 and a target of Rs 6,025.KPR MillThough KPR MIL looks attractive due to its recent rally, one needs to be cautious since it is in the process of making bear divergence on a daily scale. Where price action is making higher highs, RSI is not complementing it.Also, volume at the top is huge, which is a sign of exhaustion according to volume at price analysis. Thus, we advise you to avoid fresh longs and try to book profits in the zone of Rs 820\u2013840.Sun TV NetworkSun TV Network has given a stellar return of 58 percent in just 3 months\u2019 time. At the current juncture, maintaining a cautious approach would be the need of the hour due to the following reasons:> The current price action on the weekly chart is way above the Ichimoku cloud, which is a matter of concern.> Rs 662 levels will be stiff resistance since it is the 0.618 retracement point of the 2018 January high of 888.> The weekly ADX (average directional index) line is way above both DMI's, which might call for some booking at the counter.Thus, book profit in the zone of Rs 660\u2013675 and avoid fresh longs.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "With Cipla's promoters, the Hamieds, looking out for potential buyers to divest their stake, one of the biggest India Inc takeovers is brewing.Cipla's peers and private equity firms, including Blackstone and Baring Asia, are said to be jostling for the pharma jewel. While Torrent Pharma, a smaller rival, has emerged as a frontrunner, on the other side, Dr Reddy's Labs was reportedly approached by Bain Capital to make a joint bid for Cipla.The promoters currently own a 33.47 percent stake in Cipla, which means acquiring their stake would trigger a mandatory open offer for an additional 26 percent stake, potentially resulting in the buyer holding majority ownership of up to 59.47 percent in Cipla. Considering Cipla's current market capitalisation, this transaction would carry a substantial value of over $7 billion, making it the biggest deal in the Indian pharmaceutical sector.The news of the acquisition has also set in motion a slew of speculations over who could win the battle and what the future may look like for Cipla.Given that the deal will likely take place at Cipla's current market price (CMP), analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities (KIE) feel that the ability of PE investors to derive a healthy internal rate of return (IRR) could be constrained. Hence, they see a higher possibility of a strategic investor acquiring Cipla is higher at its CMP.Brushing aside the idea of PE investors taking over Cipla leaves two candidates in the race \u2014 Torrent Pharma and Dr Reddy's.How will the economics work out for Torrent Pharma and Dr Reddy's?The fact that Torrent Pharma is eyeing a majority stake in a company, which is 2.5 times its size in sales, is remarkable and daunting at the same time. While Torrent does have an impeccable track record of acquisitions in the recent past, like that of Elder Pharma, Unichem Labs and most recently, Curatio Healthcare, some analysts also have concerns about the risks that the debt burden may bring for the company.A common thread tying together Torrent Pharma and Dr Reddy's in their quest to take over Cipla is the consequent rise in their near-term debt levels. Assuming the deal happens at CMP, the buyer would need $7.3 billion to acquire Cipla promoters\u2019 entire stake and complete the 26 percent open offer (assuming 100 percent subscription).If Torrent wins the race, foreign brokerage Jefferies believes that the company will be used as a vehicle to acquire Cipla rather than the former's promoters buying out the latter's promoters stake. KIE also does not consider the possibility of Torrent's or Dr Reddy's promoters directly acquiring Cipla as that would significantly limit any synergy benefits.With the assumption that Torrent Pharma can raise equity from promoters, PE or other equity investors worth $2.8-2.9 billion to the extent that their promoter stake dilutes to 51 percent from the current 71 percent, it will still need to raise debt to fulfil the remaining $4 billion. This would take Torrent's debt-to-EBITDA to 3.5 times.As for Dr Reddy's, the debt-to-EBITDA is likely to come around 1.5 times, based on the same calculations. Based on these assumptions, KIE expects a 7 percent and 4 percent earnings-per-stock dilution in FY25 earnings for Torrent Pharma and Dr Reddy's, respectively, if either acquires Cipla.Irrespective of which firm manages to gain control over Cipla, Jefferies believes that the combined entity will generate considerable free cash flows, and hence, both companies in the race should be able to handle the stretched balance sheet.Some pockets in the market also have a contrarian take on this. YES Securities for example believes that the Cipla deal would be an upfront negative for Torrent's ROCE (Return on Capital Employed)/ROE (Return on Equity), which coupled with the debt burden would have a bearing on their view if at all it becomes a reality.Also Read |\u00a0Cipla\u2019s stake change: different scenarios for the investor\u00a0Regardless, analysts at KIE feel that a higher promoter shareholding in Torrent Pharma (71.25 percent as against 26.7 percent in Dr Reddy's) provides the company with a higher flexibility as it gives another avenue for fundraising for the promoters.With that said, culturally, it is Cipla and Dr Reddy's that are more aligned with each other. \"Unlike Cipla and Dr Reddy's, where the involvement of promoters in day-to-day operations is limited, the promoter family is actively involved in the day-to-day operations of Torrent Pharma,\" KIE noted.Nonetheless, the takeover of Cipla by either of the two companies will lead to the emergence of a merged entity that will be a market leader in the domestic pharma market.Limited portfolio overlaps, a trigger for future growthAnother common thread tying Torrent Pharma and Dr Reddy's is the limited overlap of less than 3 percent and 7 percent market share with Cipla, respectively, in their domestic portfolios. KIE noted that the combined market shares of brands in an overlapping molecule are in the range of 1-18 percent and 1-22 percent for Torrent Pharma and Dr Reddy's, respectively, which limits the risk of divestments.The India business was the biggest contributor for both Cipla and Torrent in FY23, while the North American market seized the deal for Dr Reddy's.Coming to the international market, there is barely any overlap in the portfolios of Cipla and Torrent Pharma. However, there is a slightly higher overlap for Dr Reddy's, especially within international markets, specifically in US generics, which brokerages believe is unlikely to yield meaningful synergies.Cipla and Torrent Pharma \u2014 what are the synergies?Cipla's robust presence in South Africa complements Torrent Pharma's strong presence in Brazil, KIE highlighted. In emerging markets, getting product registrations and establishing an 'on the ground' presence is difficult and hence, Jefferies believes that for the combined entity cross-selling of products in target emerging markets can lead to faster scale-up of operations.In the domestic market, Torrent has a strong presence in cardiac, neuro, vitamins and minerals while Cipla is well-oiled in respiratory and anti-infective segments. Cipla also has a well-established trade in the generics segment (about 20 percent of India sales) and a recently established Consumer Health division.YES Securities seconded the view as it believes Cipla and Torrent's complementary presence would also bring a larger US business into the latter's fold, a not-so-keen geography for its management.According to brokerage firm IIFL Securities, Cipla\u2019s acquisition would make a great strategic fit for Torrent as it would catapult the merged entity to a numero uno position in the Indian market, strengthen its acute portfolio, particularly in therapies of respiratory and anti-infectives, and also provide access to Cipla\u2019s diversified US pipeline of inhalation and complex injectables.Cipla and Dr Reddy's \u2014 what does the merged entity look like?The case is completely different for Dr Reddy's as it has a slightly higher domestic and international overlap with Cipla. However, unlike Torrent Pharma, where there is a meaningful difference in scale, KIE does not expect any major operational challenges for Dr Reddy's in managing Cipla\u2019s US operations, considering its US business is about 1.7 times that of Cipla\u2019s in the segment.As for other geographies, Dr Reddy's has a prominent presence in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). However, Cipla has a negligible presence in this region. Both these companies are active in Europe, which could provide some scope for rationalisation in the region, KIE believes.Moreover, there is one space where neither Dr Reddy's nor Cipla have a marked presence, that is biosimilars and specialty, where peer Sun Pharma leads. Based on that, KIE feels the combined entity will have a higher ability to pursue biosimilars and specialty forays in developed markets.Also, Cipla\u2019s acquisition would propel Dr Reddy's into a leader in the domestic pharma market, aligned with its stated ambition of being among the top five players in India.Overall, KIE sees synergies for both Torrent and Dr Reddy's with Cipla, driven by the rationalisation of Medical Representative costs, marketing and promotional expenses, as well as the optimisation of corporate and manufacturing overheads.Despite the various permutations and combinations being put out, the deal is yet to reach its course.

The acquisition will cost Cipla $48.6 million and will be done through its\u00a0wholly-owned subsidiary in South Africa.Also Read:\u00a0Why PE firms may find Cipla acquisition a different ball gameThe company has\u00a0called this move as a 'strategic acquisition', highlighting its intention to capitalise on cost synergies within the South African market. Given Actor Pharma's concentration on the consumer-driven market and its upcoming product launches, Cipla anticipates a significant increase in its over-the-counter (OTC) revenue as a result of this acquisition.\"This is in line with our strategy of strengthening our OTC and wellness portfolio. We believe this is an excellent opportunity to leverage our existing marketing capabilities, unlock future growth opportunities and optimise the performance of our pipeline\" said Umang Vohra, global managing director and chief executive officer\u00a0at\u00a0Cipla.On September 4, shares of Cipla had settled 0.5 percent lower at Rs 1,238.85 on the National Stock Exchange.Also Read:\u00a0Cipla to acquire South Africa-based Actor PharmaDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
