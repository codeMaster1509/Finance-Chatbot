While revenue was in line with estimates, profitability was lower than expectation, partly due to lower pricing in the generic API segment. We reduce our earnings estimate by 5%/3% for FY24/FY25, factoring in a) increased competition in the API segment, and b) higher tax rate, partly offset by improved growth momentum in the Nutraceutical business.OutlookWe value DIVI at 35x 12M forward earnings to arrive at a price target of INR3,330. We are building 25% earnings CAGR over FY23-25 (adjusting for COVID-led business in FY23).

    "Pharmaceutical major Divi's Laboratories reported a weak set of earnings for the July-September quarter, marked by a sharp contraction in operating margins which have turned brokerages bearish on the stock.The company missed the Street\u00a0estimate by recording a\u00a029.50 percent year-on-year decline in consolidated net profit to Rs 348 crore in Q2, when its revenue increased a mere 3 percent.Operating margin also contracted sharply to\u00a025.1 percent as against 33.5 percent in the base period, facing the heat of\u00a0lower pricing in the generic API (active pharmaceutical ingredients) segment.While Divi's legacy molecules are reeling under pricing pressure, its optimum market share in the category restricts the scope of any further growth upside.\u00a0Hence,\u00a0Nuvama Institutional Equities believes future growth for Divi's\u00a0to be heavily dependent on new growth drivers.The company too seems to be taking\u00a0this into account as its plans for\u00a0capacity expansion at its Kakinada plant which may help free up capacities in Unit 1 and Unit 2 to pursue newer growth opportunities.While Nuvama does\u00a0acknowledge that the capacity expansion underway and promising opportunities for Divi's Labs in contrast to media and peptides could serve as its next leg of growth drivers,\u00a0the brokerage is also mindful of\u00a0the\u00a0uncertainty\u00a0over its performance.On that account, the brokerage feels its\u00a0estimates for double-digit revenue and nearly 17 percent PAT CAGR (compounded annual growth rate) for Divi's over FY23\u201326 factors in growth from these opportunities. Likewise, Nuvama has a 'reduce' call on Divi's Labs, with a price target of Rs\u00a03,070.Follow our live blog for all the market actionMotilal Oswal cut its earnings estimate for Divi's by 5 percent and 3\u00a0percent for FY24 and FY25, factoring in\u00a0increased competition in the API segment, and higher tax rate, which are partly offset by improved growth momentum in the nutraceuticals business.The brokerage also believes that the current valuation adequately factors the upside in earnings and hence it maintains a 'neutral' call on the stock with a price target of Rs\u00a03,330.Foreign brokerage firm Jefferies too cut its FY24-26 EPS (earnings-per-share) estimates for Divi's by 15-18 percent on the back of its weak Q2 show. In addition, Jefferies also downgraded the stock to a 'hold' while slashing its price target by over 18 percent to Rs\u00a03,510.While the firm does expect some sequential pick-up in growth from Q3, it also feels that key growth drivers like scale-up in new capacities for contrast media still stand a year away.At 09.28 am, shares of Divi's Laboratories settled nearly a percent\u00a0lower at Rs\u00a03,475.15\u00a0on the NSE.Also Read |\u00a0Divi's Lab Q2 results: Net profit down 29% to Rs 348 crore, misses estimatesDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "Pharma major Divi's Laboratories on November 6 reported a 29.50 percent year-on-year (YoY)\u00a0decline in its consolidated net profit to Rs 348 crore for the July-September quarter of the current financial year, missing estimates.The company reported a profit of Rs 493.60 crore in the same period last year. The weak profit growth can be accounted to a higher base\u00a0due to the stellar contribution from the COVID-19 drug Molnupiravir in the same period of the last fiscal.Revenue came in at Rs 1,909 crore up merely 3\u00a0percent from the year-ago quarter numbers of Rs 1,855 crore. A poll of\u00a0eight brokerages collated by\u00a0Moneycontrol\u00a0had pegged net profit at Rs 423 crore and revenue at Rs 1,913.2 crore.Aside from an unfavourable base, analysts had also anticipated softening of overall active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) prices to weigh on the company's Q2 results.Operational performance also remained weak as\u00a0the company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) came in at Rs 479 crore, down around 23 percent from Rs 621 crore clocked in the year-ago period due to higher other expenses and lower currency gains. The EBITDA margin also contracted sharply to 25.1 percent against 33.5 percent in the base\u00a0period.The compny's EPS (earnings-per-stock) stands at 13.11 as against 18.60 in the year-ago period.The management appeared optimistic in terms of its opportunities in its earnings call. Its two big custom synthesis projects have now gone full scale now.The management said that it sees an opportunity in complex amino acid products, as it is the only player outside of China. They said that they are the most backward integrated company. They added that volume trends in generic APIs is strong, but pricing pressure is keeping revenues muted.Shares of the drugmaker also reacted negatively to its earnings announcement as they were trading 1.3 lower at Rs 3,308.95 on the NSE as of 1.02 pm. Shares of Divi's Labs have dropped 11.5 percent in the past three months over the company's consistently weak performance.\n       ",
    "Pharma major Divi's Laboratories is expected to post a sequential improvement in its revenue and net profit for Q2 FY24. The drugmaker is scheduled to detail its July-September earnings on November 6. A year-on-year (YoY) growth comparison doesn't sit well for Divi's because of a\u00a0high base due to the\u00a0stellar contribution from the COVID-19 drug Molnupiravir last fiscal.According to a poll of brokerages collated by Moneycontrol, the drugmaker is expected to report a net profit of Rs 423 crore down by 14.3 percent from Rs\u00a0493.60 crore clocked in the year-ago period. Sequentially, net profit is seen up 8 percent from the previous quarter's Rs\u00a01,778 crore.Revenue is seen rising a modest 3 percent YoY to Rs\u00a01,913.20 crore compared to Rs\u00a01,854.54 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal. On a sequential basis, however, the growth comes to around 8 percent. The expectations of\u00a0moderate sequential growth are on account of lower export\u00a0shipment data for August, Nuvama Institutional Equities pointed out.Meanwhile, much of the sales growth in Q2 is likely to be driven by\u00a0generics and nutraceuticals, Kotak Institutional Equities believes. Some contribution is also expected from\u00a0new non-COVID projects.Among the brokerages polled by Moneycontrol, Incred Equities had the lowest growth projections for Divi's Labs while Jefferies pegged the maximum growth.Incred Equities also believes that\u00a0a sequential improvement is already factored in for Divi's Labs and a\u00a0miss on this front could lead to a sharp cut in its earnings.The drugmaker is also expected to witness a sequential margin improvement on the back of a better product mix\u00a0and higher gross margins, brokerage firm Prabhudas Lilladher highlighted in its report. KIE pegged a 20 basis point sequential expansion in gross margins for Q2 on the back of stabilising raw material prices.On that account, Nuvama expects\u00a0EBITDA margin to recover gradually to ~30.2 percent (+200 basis points sequentially) but remain substantially lower than its historical run-rate of 34-35\u00a0percent.Aside from that, softening overall API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients) prices will also weigh on Divi's Q2 earnings.Prabhudas Lilladher also believes that the company's\u00a0outlook on\u00a0margins and growth in high-margin custom synthesis\u00a0will remain the\u00a0key monitorables for stakeholders.\n       ",
    "Marcellus Investment Managers believes that its \u2018consistent compounders\u2019, the likes of Asian Paints, Divi's, Bajaj Finance, will continue to maintain their dominance in the market amid heightened competition on the back of strong moats. Even with the threat of Grasim's big bang entry into paints segment looming large, star fund manager Saurabh Mukherjea is certain that Asian Paints will hold on to its market share.A note by Marcellus says that companies which are able to demonstrate the ability of strong moats over decades are the ones that have built and continuously strengthened their competitive positioning against its peers. While on the surface it may appear that a new competitor poses a credible threat to the market leader, making a judgment about this without really understanding how strong the leading company's moat is can be very risky.The note gives an example of a new IPL cricket team, backed by a wealthy owner, would pose a challenge to the champions who have dominated the league consistently over several years. However, it is difficult for the new team to defeat the leaders as the team needs brilliance and something more than just a large balance sheet.Talking about Asian Paints it says that the company\u2019s moat comes from its paint dealers. Asian Paints has close relationship with paint dealers who make money by selling the company\u2019s products because of its efficient logistics system. While it may appear that a new entrant can easily persuade a paint dealer to push its products through higher margins, such a strategy is unlikely to work without adversely impacting the new entrant\u2019s financial position. \u201cThe win-win solutions adopted by the likes of Asian Paints takes decades to establish and unless the incumbent grows lethargic, such an incumbent is incredibly difficult to dislodge,\u201d as per the note.In the context of Grasim\u2019s entry in the paint industry, Marcellus says that spending money on factories doesn't necessarily guarantee sales or a big market share. If it was the case, multi-national paint players in India \u2013 who were never short of money to invest in creating capacities\u00a0\u2013 would also be market leaders, said the note. While other paint companies are building capacities, Asian Paints has doubled its reach in rural areas and invested in making their paint cheaper.Talking about Divi\u2019s Laboratories it said that the company has three strengths. The company is 100 percent IP compliant. It is a non-competing service provider to its clients which are the world\u2019s largest pharma companies, and it has a high-quality manufacturing process which also scores highly on regulatory complianceDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "Motilal Oswal's research report on Divi\u2019s LaboratoriesThe operational performance of Divi\u2019s Laboratories (DIVI) missed our estimates marginally in 1QFY24, due to lower sales in generics and custom synthesis. However, EBITDA margin expanded sequentially owing to lower raw material/logistics costs. We reduce our earnings estimates for FY24/FY25 by 3%/5% to account for a gradual off-take in custom synthesis/nutraceutical sales in the near term and extended benefits of cost management activities. We value DIVI at 35x 12M forward earnings to arrive at a TP of INR3,430. DIVI continued to add capacity for product development/manufacturing and strengthen its capability in the contrast media space as one of the key levers of growth over the next 3-5 years. Further, being a leader in the core generic portfolio with the lowest cost, DIVI is in a good stead to see better growth than the market in respective molecules.

    "Divi's Laboratories, India's largest API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient) manufacturer, sits amid a changing landscape within the global pharmaceutical universe. The growth levers for Divi\u2019s are plenty, and gaining market share from its Chinese rivals tops that list.The company competes with several Chinese firms and has emerged as a preferred partner by Western pharma companies for several molecules on the back of three pillars \u2013 its strong IP (Intellectual Property) compliance, non-competition with its own API clients by running a formulations business, and very efficient and cost-effective manufacturing processes.Marcellus Investment Managers highlighted that Divi's Labs is a global cost champion for many of its APIs such as naproxen, dextromethorphan and levetiracetam. \"Given the backdrop of the shift in API manufacturing to India, companies like Divi\u2019s can win big,\" the firm believes.Over the years, Divi's has also made systematic investments towards ramping up its manufacturing efficiency and taking up projects towards backward integration, steps that make up the building blocks of strong future growth. What's more interesting is that its calculated capital expenditures over the years have managed to keep the company debt free.Also read:\u00a0GMM Pfaudler: All set to shatter its glass ceiling and create a new oneA future of resilient growthTo set things straight, the drugmaker's financials has remained under pressure post the pandemic due to a high base from Covid-related sales and an inflationary environment for raw materials used in APIs.Despite the drag on earnings, the company has remained focused on setting up new triggers that can fuel its next leg of growth. Starting off is the company's foray into contrast media APIs, which have global sales of around $5 billion. The company has already completed client validation for the segment from one big pharma player and is in the process of closing the deal with another. With some of the world\u2019s biggest pharma companies like Novartis, Sanofi, GSK, and Merck as its clients, it is only a matter of time before Divi's manages to scale up its newly ventured vertical, analysts believe.Along with that, the company's generics API portfolio is also set to expand over FY23-FY25 as many of the molecules targeted by Divi\u2019s go off-patent over this duration, Marcellus Investment Managers noted. The market sales value of these molecules is around $20 billion.And lastly, the most critical growth multiplier for the company is the growing China+1 sentiment among big pharma players as they try to reduce their dependence on Chinese API firms. Divi's Labs presents itself as a perfect alternative to Chinese API giants thanks to its cost leadership, existing capacity, excellent regulatory track record, operational efficiency and laser-sharp focus on IP compliance.Additionally, Motilal Oswal Financial Services feels that Divi's stands to gain market share and improve profitability in the API generics segment on the back of its efforts towards low-cost manufacturing through backward integration. Likewise, the firm expects Divi's to post a 14 percent revenue CAGR (Compounded Annual Growth Rate) to Rs 4,300 crore over FY23-25.Also read:\u00a0Demographic dividend to keep India growing for next 30 years: Commerce AS Rajesh AgrawalWhat about valuations?The stock has taken a sharp hit since the start of 2022, having slumped over 45 percent till March of this year.

As a result, the stock currently trades a valuation of 45.2 times its FY24 core earnings-per-stock estimates, which brokerages believe are a bit expensive.The pricey valuation of the stock is among the few negatives that have irked analysts.

    "Pharmaceutical player Divi's Laboratories' lower-than-expected numbers have disappointed brokerages with some of them flagging valuation concerns, saying it limits the scope for a strong upside.The drug-maker recorded a\u00a049.3 percent decline in consolidated net profit at Rs 356 crore in the April-June quarter, well below the Street's estimate of\u00a0Rs 407.8 crore. It topline at\u00a0Rs 1,778 crore was up\u00a021.2 percent on year but was lower than analysts' expectation of\u00a0Rs 2,038 crore.Several brokerages,\u00a0including Goldman Sachs, Jefferies, HSBC, and Motilal Oswal Financial Services,\u00a0have been disappointed by the performance. Shares of Divi's Labs also opened lower on August 16 and at 09.35 am, were trading 1.26 lower at Rs 3,683.45 on the NSE.A sequential improvement in operating profit margin, or the EBITDA margin, which was at\u00a028.3 percent, up from 25 percent in the March quarter, was a\u00a0saving grace for the company. The EBITDA margin, however, contracted by 930 basis points from the year-ago quarter.One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.Brokerage viewsGoldman Sachs attributed the sequential improvement in margins to an uptick in gross margins. It also retained its \u201cbuy\u201d call on the stock with a target price of Rs 3,885.Jefferies, too, has a \u201cbuy\u201d call on the stock and raised the price target by over 19 percent to Rs 4,300. The firm sees a ramp-up of the project for manufacturing Sacubitril Valsartan (a drug used in heart failure) and other base business products as near-term growth triggers for\u00a0Divi's. It also expects the company's new contrast media project to be online by the end of FY25.But not all brokerages share the optimism. HSBC, Nuvama Institutional Equities and MOSFL point to expensive valuations of the stock.Follow our live blog for all the market actionThe three brokerages believe that the valuation prices in the growth triggers, limiting the scope for a strong upside.On that account, Nuvama and HSBC have a \u201creduce\u201d call on the stock, while MOFSL maintains a \u201cneutral\u201d rating. The three brokerages also have target prices for the stock in the range of Rs 2,890-3,430, reflecting a downside of 8-22.5 percent from the closing price on August 14.HSBC also sees a long road to recovery for Divi's, a view shared by Nuvama. \"We acknowledge the promising opportunities for Divi's arising from its contrast media business and custom synthesis project along with easing raw material prices which could serve as the next leg of growth drivers for the company, but also note the uncertainty around it,\" Nuvama said in its report.MOFSL is confident of a brighter future for Divi's because of its leadership position in select molecules but said current\u00a0valuations adequately factor in the earnings upside over the next two years.Nuvama and MOFSL have cut their\u00a0earnings estimates for FY24/FY25 by\u00a03 percent/6 percent and\u00a03 percent/5\u00a0percent, respectively.Also Read |\u00a0Divi's Labs Q1 results: Net profit slumps 49% to Rs 356 crore, lags estimateDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "Rupak De, senior technical analyst at LKP SecuritiesThe Nifty remained in sideways movement over the past two days, suggesting a lack of demand at higher levels. However, the overall trend remains strong, as the index continues to sit comfortably above critical moving averages, indicating absence of aggressive short positions at this time.On the higher end, the resistance is placed between 19,450 and 19,500 which the Nifty might face some difficulty in surpassing. Looking ahead, it is expected that the Nifty will likely continue to trade sideways, as long as it sustains within the range of 19,200 to 19,500, implying a range bound trades unless there is a directional breakout.The Bank Nifty recently experienced selling pressure from higher levels, but the bears were unable to break the support at 45,000. As a result, the index has been trading within a range of 45,000-45,500. A break on either side of this range will determine the next directional move for the index.If the index breaks below the support level of 45,000, it is likely to witness further downside towards 44,500 and potentially lower. On the other hand, if the index manages to surpass the level of 45,500 on a closing basis, it will indicate strength and may lead to further upside towards the 46,000 level.Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:Indiabulls Housing Finance: Buy | LTP: Rs 130.5 | Stop-Loss: Rs 124 | Target: Rs 145 | Return: 11 percentIndiabulls Housing Finance has experienced a Head and Shoulder breakout, indicating a potential upward trend.

    "The market closed a rangebound session off the day's high because of selling pressure in last hour of trade on May 23, continuing the uptrend for the third straight day as buying was seen in metals, auto, pharma, and oil and gas stocks.The BSE Sensex gained 18 points to 61,982, and the Nifty50 34 points to 18,348, while the Nifty Midcap 100 index gained six-tenth of a percent and Smallcap 100 index stayed flat with a positive bias.Bank Nifty rebounded after a correction in the previous session, but failed to sustain the 44,000 mark. The index gained 69 points to 43,954.Stocks that were in action on Tuesday included Route Mobile which rallied 4 percent to Rs 1,468.35, the highest closing level since September 13 last year, and formed bullish candlestick pattern with long upper shadow on the daily scale with strong volumes.Bajaj Electricals shares gained 1 percent to Rs 1,212.60, the highest closing levels since December 30, and formed a small-bodied bullish candle with long upper shadow on the daily charts, indicating profit-booking at higher levels after hitting the highest levels on intraday basis since August last year.Divis Laboratories continued to see healthy volumes for yet another session. It jumped 3.7 percent to Rs 3,385.8, the highest closing level since May 10 and formed a long, bullish candlestick pattern on the daily scale for second consecutive session.Here's what Rohan Shah of Stoxbox recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:Route MobileThe price action of Route Mobile supposedly took a breather by means of profit taking bouts after 282 percent run-up from the listing day. The price action corrected 56 percent from the all-time high and entered into a lateral trading range after losing the downside momentum.The current sideway trend not only hints at a more significant support level, but also that the ownership of stocks are potentially transferring from weak to strong hands.We thus reiterate going long in Route Mobile with entry in the range of Rs 1,475-1,435 with an upside move towards Rs 1,730-1,750 zone. On the flip side, Rs 1,377-1,360 to act key support area.Bajaj ElectricalsThe stock rallied almost more than 40 percent from the June 2022 low and post that stock turned sideways, trading in the channel which contained for more than 10 months.The stock staged a breakout from the said channel this week with strong volumes and supportive momentum. Thus going forward if breakout unfolds well on expected line, price is expected to head higher towards Rs 1,280-1,300 levels, whereas, Rs 1,190-1,170 shall provide key support zone.Divis LaboratoriesThe stock broke out of from descending resistance trendline in April 2023. After that stock went into consolidation mode for almost a month and now previous resistance zone acted as support for the stock.In last two days, the stock has been trading well above the support zone with good gains.
