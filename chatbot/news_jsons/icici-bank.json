The brokerage\u2019s target price of Rs 1,350 per share implies a 15 percent upside from the previous close.The bank is likely to emphasise quality underwriting, said Motilal Oswal in a note, adding that the bank's liability momentum remains strong and it is committed to leveraging superior technology to aid customer acquisition.The brokerage expects ICICI Bank's Net Interest Margins (NIMs) to remain range bound in the near term, while its asset quality remains robust, with credit costs expected to normalise gradually.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "India's market has grown substantially, attracting truly global funds with the ability to invest anywhere in the world. In the past, during the peak of China's market, global funds typically held two or three China e-commerce internet stocks in their portfolios.However, this trend has largely changed, with global investors now favouring one, two, or three mega-cap Indian stocks, according to Jonathan Garner, Chief Equity Strategist for Asia and Emerging Markets at Morgan Stanley.\"This shift has already begun and is expected to accelerate,\" Garner told Moneycontrol in an interview. Simultaneously, India is experiencing a retail-driven boom in small and medium stocks, alongside a surge in options trading.This reflects a broader trend of wealth creation among India's young and dynamic population, he added.Follow our market blog to catch all the live actionGlobal investors now prioritise liquidity and substantial market exposure relative to their benchmark index. Previously, when India constituted a smaller segment, it was often overlooked.However, with India now positioned as the second-largest market in emerging markets and poised to become the largest, global investors cannot afford to disregard its significance, emphasised Garner.He further highlighted several pockets of growth within the Indian market. \"What we like particularly is domestic demand plays,\" he explained. This includes sectors like consumer discretionary, industrials, financials, and real estate.Notably, real estate, a sector previously not recommended for exposure in India, is now gaining momentum.Garner expressed bullishness on specific stocks including ICICI Bank, Maruti Suzuki, GAIL, and Godrej Properties in real estate. In contrast, Morgan Stanley is more cautious on externally earning sectors such as IT services, outsourcing names, pharmaceuticals, and defensive stocks, though they are not in a defensive posture on India overall.The analyst noted a recent shift in sentiment towards consumer and IT stocks post-election, as opposed to infrastructure, capital goods, and other economy-sensitive stocks.With a significant CapEx cycle in recent years, Garner anticipates a continued emphasis on infrastructure but expects the focus to gradually shift towards consumer-driven sectors, which offer a robust environment and a wide range of investment opportunities.Also Read |\u00a0India poised to replace China as largest market in EM index: Morgan Stanley's Jonathan GarnerJonathan Garner's insights underscore the evolving landscape of India's market development and sectoral preferences.

    "The National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) has refused to stay an NCLT order admitting infrastructure firm Jaiprakash Associates Limited into insolvency resolution process.The NCLAT said on June 10 that the Interim Resolution Professional submitted that neither the company\u2019s 25,000 employees nor ongoing projects would be affected, as IRP intended to run the company as a going concern.Sunil Kumar Sharma, a suspended company director, sought the stay.The NCLAT has directed banks to respond to the appeal and asked them to consider the company\u2019s one-time settlement offer. The case will now be heard on June 24.Senior advocate Sandeep Sethi, who appeared for Sharma, told the court that the order of insolvency had put many infrastructure projects, in India and abroad, in jeopardy. The company had offered an OTS plan but the NCLT admitted the company to insolvency resolution process before a decision could be reached.The company had already deposited Rs 200 crore of the outstanding Rs 1200 crore it owed to ICICI Bank, he said. The OTS would have worked itself out in four and a half months if the NCLT had not passed the insolvency order.Senior advocate Sanjib Sen, who appeared for ICICI Bank, said it was not a straight-forward case as was being made out and the NCLAT should not stay the insolvency process.The company owed more than Rs 30,000 crore to various banks and Rs 1,200 crore to ICICI, Sen said. It would set a wrong example if the proceedings were stayed.The case has been pending in courts for a decade and Jaiprakash Associates tried to defer the insolvency proceedings by seven years on one pretext or the other.A vacation bench of NCLAT, while refusing to stay the order of the NCLT\u2019s Allahabad bench, said it would pass a detailed order giving instructions to the lenders.Jaiprakash Associates\u00a0has a debt of Rs 29,361 crore, including interest. In all, 22 lenders have exposure to JP Associates' debt.The company has been trying to sell its cement plants to trim the debt but media reports have said the fate of the deal with Dalmia Cement remains uncertain.Jaiprakash Associates and Dalmia Bharat in December 2022 signed a framework for the acquisition\u00a0of JAL's cement, clinker and power plants for an enterprise value of Rs 5,666 crore.The National Asset Reconstruction Company of India (NARCL) in March-April submitted an Rs 10,000-crore binding offer to acquire JAL's debt but the lenders sought a better offer, reports said.\n       ",
    "Acting on several complaints by shareholders of ICICI Securities, some of who received calls by ICICI Bank seeking favourable vote for the delisting scheme, market regulator SEBI has issued an administrative warning on the outreach.An exchange filing by ICICI Bank on June 6 cited regulator's observation that said, \"The heightened outreach programme on the last day of voting citing holidays/weekend appears inappropriate\".ICICI Bank's exchange filing cited Sebi's circular, which said the outreach programme was undertaken to explain the scheme of delisting of ICICI Securities and to maximize shareholders' participation. However, investor complaints revealed that some officials had 'gone beyond the outreach programme' and made repeated calls, and even sought screenshots of voting.According to one of the call recordings, a shareholder of ICICI Securities was told that opting for the scheme would be beneficial, a clear breach of the remit of the outreach programme, Sebi's\u00a0letter\u00a0revealed.Sebi's letter said, \"... bank being a promoter/ interested party, providing its perspective on the proposed transaction to shareholders of I-Sec cannot be said to be providing a balanced factual position. There was a clear conflict of interest..\"As many as 83.8 percent of the public institutional shareholders and 32 percent non-institutional shareholders of ICICI Bank had voted in favour of ICICI Securities' delisting, the bank had said a regulatory filing on March 27.The regulator warned ICICI Bank to be careful\u00a0and expected it to improve the compliance standards to avoid such instances, failing which Sebi saidaction may be initiated.The bank has been advised to place the actions taken in this regard\u00a0before the next meeting and forward SEBI a brief on the discussions within 10 days of the Board meeting.\n       ",

    "In the absence of bulls, bears further strengthened their grip on the market on May 30, the monthly F&O expiry day, and dragged the benchmark Nifty 50 below the 22,500 mark for the first time since May 17. The lower highs-lower lows formation continued with a negative bias in the momentum indicator Relative Strength Index (RSI). However, the positive point is that the index managed to sustain above 50 percent of the Fibonacci retracement level as well as the 20-day SMA (Simple Moving Average).

    "The ICICI Securities delisting saga faced another setback when the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) postponed the case until July amidst concerns from minority shareholders regarding the company's potential breach of shareholders' privacy and manipulation of the voting process.Last month, over 100 shareholders of ICICI Securities, led by Manu Rishi Gupta, initiated a class-action lawsuit against the company's delisting and its merger plan with ICICI Bank.The lawsuit claimed that ICICI Securities had disclosed confidential shareholder information to ICICI Bank, compromising the privacy and independence of investors. Now, let's take a look at what the story has been so far!ICICI Bank board approves ICICI Securities delisting on June 2023ICICI Bank's board approved the delisting of ICICI Securities on June 29, 2023. According to the scheme, public shareholders of ICICI Securities would receive 67 equity shares of ICICI Bank for every 100 shares of ICICI Securities, resulting in ICICI Securities becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of ICICI Bank upon delisting.ALSO READ:\u00a0ICICI Securities names two bankers as co-heads of ECM businessCurrently, ICICI Bank holds a 74.73 percent stake in ICICI Securities, with public shareholders owning the remaining shares. Notable among these public shareholders are Norway's Norges Bank Investment Management, with a 3.2 percent stake, followed by Life Insurance Corporation and California-based Capital Group.Investors raise concern about depressed valuation, share-swap ratioAt the time of announcement, ICICI Securities share price was hovering just above its intial public offering (IPO) issue price of Rs 520, igniting debates about the stock's true value.As the proposal progressed,\u00a0concerns regarding the depressed valuation and share-swap ratio of ICICI Securities intensified. Market participants and shareholders questioned the fairness of the deal, especially given the stock's low price relative to its potential.Manu Rishi Gupta, a minority shareholder and SEBI registered PMS provider, rallied over 500 shareholders to oppose the delisting resolution. Gupta highlighted the significant disparity between the valuation during ICICI Securities' IPO in 2018 and its delisting offer.\"During the ICICI Securities IPO in 2018, the shares were offered at a valuation of 30x trailing earnings. At the time of delisting today, ICICI Bank is offering just 18x of FY23 earnings,\" he said.ICICI Securities delisting plan passes regulatory hurdles - RBI, BSE, NSE give nodThe good news came in for ICICI Bank after ICICI Securities delisting proposal passed\u00a0its first regulatory hurdle. The\u00a0Reserve Bank of India (RBI) gave nod to delist ICICI Securities on November 9, 2023,\u00a0to make it ICICI Bank's wholly-owned subsidiary, subject to certain conditions.Later,\u00a0it also received 'no objection' letters from stock exchanges BSE and NSE for delisting shares of the broking arm on November 29, 2023.ALSO READ:\u00a0ICICI Bank under SEBI lens; watchdog examining complaints in ICICI Securities delisting case, says reportDiscontent\u00a0grows, investors spell concern at public forum for the first timeHowever, discontent among investors surfaced\u00a0in a post-earnings analyst conference call on January 16, 2024, where shareholders expressed concerns about the swap ratio and argued for the company to remain listed. Despite this, ICICI Bank received NCLT approval for the shareholders' voting process on January 18, 2024.But this also came to no avail. On January 18, 2024, ICICI Bank informed exchanges that it has received NCLT approval for shareholders' voting process\u00a0in March.Shareholders give ICICI Securities delisting approval\u00a0Ultimately, the delisting of ICICI Securities was approved on March 28, 2024, with 71.89 percent of votes in favor of merging ICICI Securities with ICICI Bank, despite resistance from retail investors. However, concerns about vote manipulation and breaching of shareholder privacy persisted.Around 16 domestic mutual funds voted in favour of ICICI Bank's proposal to delist its broking arm. However, around 7 mutual fund houses opposed the plan.Mutual fund houses such as Kotak, Mahindra Manulife, Samco, Quantum, ITI, LIC, and Baroda BNP voted against the delisting proposal. However, asset management companies like UTI, Axis, Aditya Birla, HDFC, ICICI Prudential, Nippon, Mirae Asset, DSP, SBI, Sundaram, Bandhan, NJ, among others.Vote manipulation, breaching of shareholder privacy concerns dial upIn spite of the delisting nod, clamour grew over ICICI Bank meddling with votes and calling ICICI Securities shareholders in the guise of 'awareness' campaigns to gain support for delisting.Voicing these concerns,\u00a0a group of shareholders led by Bengaluru-based investment manager then approached NCLT last month.According to lawsuit filed by Gupta and fellow minority shareholders, ICICI Securities was alleged to disclose confidential information to ICICI Bank, compromising shareholders privacy.NCLT defers ICICI delisting vote manipulation case to JulyIn the latest development, NCLT has deferred the case to July for further deliberation and the matter remains poised for intense scrutiny and debate.Market regulator Sebi is also investigating allegations of ICICI Bank employees contacting ICICI Securities in an attempt to influence them before a vote on delisting proposal in March.As Moneycontrol reported earlier, it is believed that minority investors of ICICI Securities filed 60-70 complaints with the SEBI and also complained on the SCORES platform about vote manipulation grievances. SCORES is SEBI's online platform for filing grievances.In the past three months, shares of ICICI Securities have tumbled over 9 percent, underperforming the 1.4 percent rise in the benchmark Nifty 50 index.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "At a time when HDFC Bank is navigating merger challenges and Kotak Mahindra Bank is rectifying discrepancies in its digital lending business, the Street has\u00a0selected ICICI Bank as the flavour of the season\u00a0in the private banking space\u00a0this April.According to Moneycontrol's Analyst Tracker, ICICI Bank has\u00a0bagged around 48 'buy' calls from brokerages and only 3 'hold' calls in April. This picture is in contrast to India's largest private lender\u00a0\u2014 HDFC Bank, which received 45 'buy' calls and 5 'hold' ratings last month.Strengthening balance sheetAs ICICI Bank reported\u00a0another strong quarterly show, brokerages maintained their bullish stance on\u00a0the lender and raised their target prices.Analysts at Geojit Financial Services\u00a0put out a 'buy' call on ICICI Bank, with a target price of Rs 1,274 per share, citing the bank's sustained growth momentum in advances and deposits driven by its technological prowess and extensive reach.\"Positive triggers such as healthy asset quality, adequate capitalisation, and digital transformation augur well for the bank\u2019s future performance,\" they wrote in a post-result analysis.Prabhudas Lilladher, too,\u00a0gave\u00a0a 'buy' call on ICICI Bank given its improved in balance sheet, and raised the target price to Rs 1,450 per share from Rs 1,300.ALSO READ:\u00a0Buy ICICI Bank; target of Rs 1355: KR ChokseyICICI Bank's share of retail\u00a0and SME loans increased to 75.4 percent in FY24, while its loan-to-deposit ratio reduced to 83.8 percent, and liquidity coverage ratio stood strong at 123 percent.\"This helps us arrive\u00a0at a return on asset (RoA)\u00a0and return on equity (RoE) of 2.1 percent\u00a0and 17.2 percent, respectively, for FY26E, which is best-in class,\" analysts at Prabhudas Lilladhersaid.ICICI Bank's net interest income climbed 19.5 percent year-on-year (YoY) to Rs 74,305 crore in FY24, from Rs 62,128 crore in FY23. Its profit-after-tax (PAT) also jumped\u00a0 28.2 percent YoY to Rs 40,888 crore in FY24, from Rs 31,896 crore in the year-ago period.Margin\u00a0pressures to\u00a0reduceWhile a higher cost of funds continues to haunt the margins of\u00a0 major banking and financial firms, analysts believe that ICICI Bank's margin drag was limited in Q4 due to ultra-low credit costs versus peers.Analysts at Bernstein shared a 'market perform' rating\u00a0(a neutral rating) on ICICI Bank, with a target price of Rs 1,150 per share.\u00a0They said that another quarter of low credit costs helped offset a marginal decline in NIMs (net interest margin).The management said there would be a gradual improvement in\u00a0the NIM in the upcoming quarters.ALSO READ:\u00a0ICICI Bank Q4 Results: Net profit jumps 17% to Rs 10,707 crore, asset quality stays healthy\"We expect margins to remain under pressure in the near-term due to deposit re-pricing, but the bank remains committed to offset this with higher yielding segments, keeping margins rangebound,\" the management explained.ICICI Bank's NIMs contracted by 33 basis points (bps) YoY to 4.6 percent, from 5 percent in the year-ago period. Sequentially, too, NIMs were down 14 bps from 4.8 percent in Q3FY24.Attractive valuations pave the way for re-ratingCurrently, ICICI Bank trades at 17.7 times\u00a0its price-to-earnings (PE) ratio, slightly above Kotak Mahindra's 17.7X PE and HDFC Bank's 17.1\u00a0X PE. However, it remains expensive compared to the sector's mean of 11.18X PE.Analysts at Bernstein\u00a0 said that this premium valuation enjoyed by ICICI Bank\u00a0compared to its\u00a0peers\u00a0was justified as the lender maintained a healthy RoA\u00a0of 2.36 percent.JP Morgan's analysts see further scope\u00a0for upward re-rating amid better growth prospects. \"We believe the valuation\u00a0is still reasonable at 13X FY26. We upgrade ICICI Bank's FY25/26 EPS by 4 percent,\" the brokerage firm added,\u00a0giving the bank\u00a0an 'overweight' rating and a target price of Rs 1,300 .So far this year, ICICI Bank's shares have surged over 13 percent, outperforming the 1 percent gain in the benchmark Nifty 50 index during the same period.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "Fitch Ratings on Thursday affirmed the ratings of Axis Bank and ICICI Bank with a stable outlook citing supportive operating environment and large domestic franchise.Fitch Ratings has affirmed India-based Axis Bank and ICICI Bank's Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BB+', the global agency said in two separate rating commentaries.Fitch has also affirmed the banks' Government Support Rating (GSR) at 'bb+' and Viability Rating (VR) at 'bb'.Fitch said its IDR ratings reflect expectation of a moderate probability of extraordinary state support from the government relative to large state banks.The agency said its expectation of a supportive operative environment is on account of India's robust medium-term growth potential. Fitch expects GDP growth of 7 per cent in 2024 and 6.5 per cent in 2025, supported by investment prospects.\"The economy has been resilient as healthy business sentiment, steady financial markets and the government's capital spending buffered global economic headwinds and inflation. These factors are conducive for banks to sustain profitable business, provided risks are well-managed,\" Fitch said.With regard to Axis Bank, Fitch said the bank's appetite for growth is likely to remain above the sector average, albeit similar to other large private banks.\"We have revised the outlook on Axis' earnings and profitability score to stable, from positive, as we do not see a significant further upside to the core metric from current levels, despite remaining high relative to the years before FY23,\" it added.On ICICI Bank, Fitch said it maintains a positive outlook on its earnings and profitability score, as it expects profitability to remain elevated relative to prior years.On ICICI Bank's large domestic franchise, Fitch said the bank has a strong retail-focused domestic franchise as India's second-largest private bank.\"This, together with above-average capitalisation, should support sustained generation of revenue and business opportunities as well as market-share expansion through the cycle,\" it added.\n       ",

    "The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is investigating allegations of ICICI Bank employees contacting ICICI Securities shareholders in an attempt to influence them before a vote on delisting proposal in March, Mint reported.During the vote, the shareholders were to decide on the delisting of ICICI Securities and its merger with its parent company, ICICI Bank. Over 500 shareholders of ICICI Securities had collaborated through WhatsApp and social media to file numerous complaints with SEBI.\"The regulator is presently reviewing several complaints. Once substantiated evidence is gathered, SEBI will commence an investigation. The specific actions SEBI may take remain uncertain,\" the Mint report quoted an unidentified source.Earlier, Manu Rishi Guptha, a Bengaluru-based fund manager and a minority shareholder in ICICI Securities, said in an exclusive interaction with Moneycontrol\u00a0that prior to the board meeting, both ICICI Securities and ICICI Bank had been reaching out to retail shareholders of the former, persuading them to vote in favor of the merger scheme.Gupta added that the\u00a0actions have also led to minority shareholder data being compromised as the calls were made by ICICI Bank and not by ICICI Securities, which means that the details were shared with them.In the Mint report, Guptha also stated that minority investors of ICICI Securities have filed 60-70 complaints with the SEBI and also complained on the SCORES platform. SCORES is SEBI's online platform for filing grievances.Also Read | MC Exclusive: Minority shareholders file class action suit against ICICI Securities on delisting concernsHe further stated that the primary accusations in these grievances involve the breach of data privacy concerning ICICI Securities' shareholders and the valuation at which the company is slated for delisting.Guptha is leading team of over 100 ICICI Securities shareholders who, last month, submitted a class action lawsuit to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) challenging ICICI Bank Ltd's bid to delist ICICI Securities.In a response to the stock exchanges, ICICI Bank clarified that the \"outreach program aimed to encourage higher participation in voting\" rather than influence decision-making. However, Quantum MF labeled this clarification as a \"smokescreen\" and an effort to conceal the \"malicious\" intentions of ICICI Securities.\"Upon initial examination of the clarification response, no valid justification is provided for the queries raised by the stock exchanges. The notice summoning the shareholder's meeting had already been dispatched in February 2024, thus rendering contacting shareholders individually unnecessary,\" the mutual fund emphasised.On March 27, minority shareholders voted in favor of delisting ICICI Securities to wholly merge the entity with its parent, ICICI Bank. Currently, the bank holds a 74.73 percent stake in the brokerage firm, with public shareholders owning the remaining shares.However, several retail shareholders, collectively owning approximately 6 percent of the company, voiced objections regarding the valuation at which the delisting was proposed.

Prior to his appointment as MD and CEO of ICICI Bank, he was a whole-time director and chief operating officer of the bank. The change of baton took place when predecessor Chandra Kochhar was forced out due to money laundering allegations, wavering investors' confidence to a low. But Bakhshi took ICICI Bank from third-largest lender in India\u00a0by m-cap\u00a0to second-largest (next only to HDFC Bank).ICICI Bank's m-cap rose to Rs 8.09 lakh crore in 2024 from Rs 2.01 lakh crore in 2018, outpacing State Bank of India's Rs 7.36 lakh crore m-cap, showed data from Bloomberg.

It appears that this rumour is being spread with an ulterior motive and malicious intent in order to harm the Bank and its stakeholders,\" the filing said.Also Read |\u00a0ICICI Bank becomes 5th Indian firm to cross Rs 8 lakh crore mcapAt 09.24 am, shares of ICICI Bank were\u00a0flat at Rs 1,150.Last week, ICICI Bank emerged as\u00a0the fifth Indian company and the second bank to surpass Rs 8-lakh-crore market capitalisation for the first time after its shares rallied over 4 percent on strong earnings.ICICI Bank reported a net profit of Rs 10,708 crore in Q4 FY24, up 20 percent from Q4 FY23, driven by robust advances and reduced credit costs, despite margin pressure.

    "On the robust rally of nearly five percent in ICICI Bank after a consolidation phase in the previous session, market analysts observe that the potential movement following a breakout from such consolidation phases could be approximately twice the width of the consolidation range.Applying this principle to ICICI Bank, \"we can reasonably set a target for the stock at around Rs 1,280,\u00a0Jigar S Patel, Senior Manager - Equity Research, at Anand Rathi said in an interview to Moneycontrol.Jigar, who has more than nine\u00a0years of experience in technical research, believes the recent price action of YES\u00a0Bank indicates a significant development in its long-term trend. Based on this technical analysis, investors may consider initiating long positions in YES\u00a0Bank within the price range of Rs 25 to 28, he advises.What is your trading strategy for ICICI Bank and State Bank of India?ICICI BankAfter a prolonged period of consolidation lasting 32 trading sessions, during which ICICI Bank's stock price traded within a relatively narrow range of Rs 1,050 to Rs 1,120, a significant development has occurred. The stock has successfully breached this consolidation range and is currently hovering around the Rs 1,160 level.From a technical standpoint, market analysts often observe that the potential movement following a breakout from such consolidation phases could be approximately twice the width of the consolidation range. Applying this principle to ICICI Bank, we can reasonably set a target for the stock at around Rs 1,280. This target reflects the anticipated magnitude of the breakout move beyond the previous range. In light of this bullish outlook, a strategy of buying on dips is recommended for investors interested in entering or increasing their positions in ICICI Bank.State Bank of IndiaIn the case of State Bank of India (SBIN), there has been a notable upward movement, amounting to a 100-point increase over the past seven trading sessions. This surge translates to a substantial gain of approximately 13 percent to 14 percent. However, it's crucial to note the emergence of a Bearish Butterfly pattern near the Rs 835-840 zone on the chart. The presence of this pattern typically indicates a potential reversal in the ongoing upside, suggesting that the stock's upward momentum might be losing steam.Given this technical signal, investors may consider the prudent strategy of booking profits on their SBIN positions. By doing so, they secure gains accrued during the recent bullish phase. Subsequently, investors can adopt a wait-and-watch approach, anticipating a meaningful correction in the stock's price. This approach allows investors to capitalise on potential buying opportunities that may arise as the stock retraces from its current elevated levels. Overall, this strategy aims to strike a balance between realising profits and positioning oneself advantageously for future market movements.Do you advise taking exposure to YES\u00a0Bank and IREDA?YES\u00a0BankThe recent price action of YES\u00a0Bank indicates a significant development in its long-term trend. After enduring a prolonged period of downward pressure, symbolised by a bearish trendline that persisted for 3.5 years, YES Bank's stock price has managed to break above this formidable resistance level. What's particularly noteworthy is that the stock has not only breached this long-standing bear line but has also retraced to retest it from above. This retest serves as a crucial confirmation that the breakout is indeed genuine, strengthening the conviction in the bullish outlook for YES\u00a0Bank.Based on this technical analysis, investors may consider initiating long positions in YES\u00a0Bank within the price range of Rs 25 to 28. The upside potential for the stock is estimated to be around Rs 41, representing a substantial increase from current levels. However, it's important to manage risk effectively in trading or investing. Therefore, a prudent approach would involve placing a stop-loss order near Rs 19 on a daily closing basis. This investment view spans over the next 8 to 12 months, reflecting a longer-term perspective on the anticipated trajectory of YES\u00a0Bank's stock price.IREDACurrently, IREDA (Indian Renewable Energy Development Agency) is encountering significant resistance around the upper boundary of the Bollinger Bands, a technical indicator that depicts volatility and potential price levels. This resistance is reinforced by the presence of a bearish candlestick formation, which typically suggests selling pressure in the market. The conjunction of these two factors indicates a challenging environment for further upward movement in the stock's price in the immediate term.Consequently, it is advisable for investors to exercise patience and await a pullback in the stock's price. This pullback is expected to lead the price down to around the Rs 160 level, offering a more favourable entry point for initiating long positions.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
