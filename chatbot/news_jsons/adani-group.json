    "Adani group is looking to invest about Rs 2 lakh crore by 2030 to build 40 gigawatts of renewable energy generation capacity, as it targets net zero emissions across businesses by 2050, top officials said on Tuesday.The apple-to-airport conglomerate currently has over 10 GW of capacity to generate electricity from renewable sources like sunlight and wind energy and is looking to add 6-7 GW every year to reach 50 GW by 2030.\"Considering the ballpark number of Rs 5 crore per megawatt, the investment could be in the range of Rs 2 lakh crore by 2030,\" Adani Green Energy Ltd Executive Director Sagar Adani told reporters here.Its CEO Amit Singh said the company would also build a 5 GW pump storage capacity to peak power demand during the night when sunlight is not available, and wind intensity is not strong enough to turn wind turbines to produce electricity. The carbon credits renewable capacity generates, together with a few other measures, will help turn the group net zero by 2050.AGEL added 2.8 GW capacity in the 2023-2024 (April 2023 to March 2024) fiscal, which was 15 per cent of India's total renewable energy capacity addition, Singh said.\"This year, our target is 6 GW,\" he said.Going forward, that kind of capacity addition or higher is likely every year, Adani said, adding that 80 per cent of the 50 GW capacity will be solar and the rest wind.The conglomerate is building factories to make wafers used in solar panels to generate electricity and wind turbines.Singh said the group is now looking at making 3 MW wind turbines for areas with lower wind speeds.It currently makes wind turbines of 5.2 MW capacity that are suited for high-potential areas like Khavada in Gujarat.India is the world's third-largest economy in terms of energy needs, and its energy demand is projected to surge 25-35 per cent by 2030. Its peak energy demand is estimated to be 366.4 GW by 2031-32.AGEL brought on a stream of 2,848 MW (2.8 GW) renewables capacity, the largest greenfield expansion in India's renewable energy sector. This included 2,418 MW solar and 430 MW wind projects.Of the capacity commissioned in FY24 includes 2,000 MW of solar capacity from Adani Green Energy's World's largest renewable energy project of 30,000 MW, being built at Khavda, Gujarat. The project is spread across 538 square kilometres, almost five times the city of Paris. Once built, it will be the largest power plant in the world, regardless of the energy source.AGEL is also targeting the addition of at least 5,000 MW pumped storage project (PSP) capacity by 2030 in the first phase, Singh said. It has begun the construction of the first 500 MW PSP in Andhra Pradesh. The company has a robust development pipeline of hydro-pumped storage projects across Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Telangana.With this, AGEL has revised its renewable energy target to 50,000 MW from 45,000 MW by 2030.AGEL's current operational portfolio is 10,934 MW, which consists of 7,393 MW solar, 1,401 MW wind and 2,140 MW wind-solar hybrid capacity. It is the first company in India to surpass the 10,000 MW renewable energy capacity.Over the past five years, its operational capacity addition has outpaced the industry, achieving a CAGR of 41 per cent compared to India's 13 per cent.AGEL's total locked-in portfolio stands at 21,953 MW (10,934 MW is operational, and 11,019 MW is under execution).About 93 per cent of AGEL's portfolio comprising 20,368 MW is now backed by 25-year fixed tariff PPAs with sovereign/sovereign equivalent counterparties, which gives it revenue predictability, and 7 per cent is merchant portfolio, offering higher realisations.\u00a0\n       ",
    "Adani Green Energy revised its renewable energy capacity target to 50 gigawatts (GW) by 2030, up from the earlier target of 45 GW, said Gautam Adani, Chairman of the Adani Group, on June 24.Speaking at the group\u2019s annual general meeting (AGM), the business tycoon said Adani Green Energy added 2.8 GW in the last year, 15 percent of India\u2019s total renewable capacity addition.The commissioning of the first 2 GW at the world\u2019s largest renewable energy plant in Khavda within 12 months of breaking ground set a record, he said adding that the achievement highlights execution capabilities of the company.\u201cAlready generating 3,000 MW of clean energy, our aggressive timeline aims to develop 30 GW capacity in the next five years. This will be enough to power nations like Belgium and Switzerland. For us, the Khavda park is a testimony of our commitment to sustainability and a symbol of national pride,\u201d said Adani.In line with India\u2019s aim to increase reliance on renewable energy, the Adani group had set a renewable energy park spread over 538 square kilometres in Khavda, Gujarat. The company had earlier pointed out that the region is endowed with one of the best wind and solar resources in the country, which makes it ideal for giga-scale RE (renewable energy) development.The region witnesses around 2,060 kWh/m2 of high solar irradiation, making it ideal for solar energy generation and speeds of around 8 meters per second, the company added.\n       ",
    "Adani Group Chairman Gautam Adani delved on the Hindenburg incident at the 32nd annual general meeting of the conglomerate on June 24 and cited the\u00a0\u00a0short-seller's over 100 pages long report on the group as \"baseless accusations\".\"It was a two-sided attack \u2013 a vague criticism of our financial standing and, at the same time, an information distortion campaign, dragging us into a political battlefield. The attack was a calculated strike two days before the closing of our Follow-on Public Offer,\"\u00a0\u00a0said Adani about the US short seller's scathing report against the conglomerate last year.Hindenburg fiascoHindenburg, in a report, accused the group of stock manipulation and improper use of tax havens triggering a sell-off in Gautam Adani's ports-to-power conglomerate.Later, an expert panel, established by the Supreme Court, found no conclusive evidence of stock manipulation by the Adani Group, though it recommended improvements to the regulatory framework to protect investors.\"Amplified by a segment of vested media, it was designed to defame us, do maximum damage and erode our hard-earned market value,\" Adani added.He further reiterated the group's efforts to navigate the crisis and said that the company\u00a0raised an additional Rs 40,000 crore,\u00a0 covering the next two years of its debt repayment.\"We safeguarded our portfolio against any volatility by pre-paying Rs 17,500 crore in margin-linked financing,\"\u00a0 said Adani in his speech at the AGM.The group's net debt to EBITDA improved to\u00a02.2 from 3.3.\"Our commitment to operational excellence and transparent disclosures was validated not only by rating agencies and the well-informed financial community, but also by respected global investors like GQG Partners, TotalEnergies, IHC, QIA and the US Development Finance Corporation \u2013 all of whom chose to invest in us.,\" added Adani.Bullish on IndiaThe group is optimistic on the domestic growth and is eyeing higher growth opportunities from government's infrastructure push.\"Given the multiplier effect, the government of India has rightly focused on infrastructure development by raising its funding by 16% to over Rs 11 lakh crore for this financial year. It is worthwhile to note that annual spending has tripled in the last 5 years,\" Adani further said.He stressed on the role of state governments in\u00a0implementing the initiatives related to infrastructure development.\"With the government now in its third term, your company is well positioned to continue the economic and social programs,\" he added.Segment updatesAdani gave an update on the conglomerate's future plans and balance sheet and reiterated the group's goal\u00a0\u00a0to develop 30 GW capacity in the next five years, which it claims will be enough to\u00a0power nations like Belgium and Switzerland.Given renewable energy\u2019s growth potential, Adani Green Energy revised its FY 2029-30 target from 45 GW to 50 GW. In the year, we added 2.8 GW, 15% of India\u2019s total renewable capacity addition, Adani said.Meanwhile, he noted that passenger traffic at Adani-operated airports stood\u00a0at 88.6 million.He also restated the group's ambitions of reaching combined cement capacity of\u00a0140 million tonne per annum by 2028. \"\u00a0Ambuja Cements was the lead supplier for India's longest sea bridge - the 21.9 km long Mumbai trans harbour link,\" added Adani.For Adani Energy Solutions,\u00a0transmission order book stands at Rs 17,000 crore, and our smart metering order book has expanded to 228 lakh units.\n       ",

    "Adani group has plans to invest over $100 billion in energy transition projects and manufacturing capability\u00c2\u00a0to\u00c2\u00a0produce every major component required for the green energy generation, Chairman of the group Gautam Adani said on June 19.Speaking at the 'Infrastructure - the Catalyst for India's Future' event organized by Crisil, Gautam Adani underscored India's immense potential of energy transition and digital infrastructure.",
    "Adani group will invest more than USD 100 billion (around Rs 835 crore) in energy transition projects and manufacturing capability to produce every major component required for green energy generation, its chairman said on Wednesday.Besides building solar parks to produce electricity from sunlight and wind farms that do the same from wind, the conglomerate is building major facilities to manufacture electrolyzers for making green hydrogen, wind power turbines and solar panels.Green hydrogen, which is made by splitting hydrogen from water with the help of electrolyzers powered by clean energy, is seen as a potential panacea for decarbonizing the industry as well as transportation.Speaking at 'Infrastructure - the Catalyst for India's Future' event of Crisil, Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani said energy transition and digital infrastructure are trillion-dollar opportunities which will transform India both at a local and at a global scale.\"The next decade will see us invest more than USD 100 billion in the energy transition space and further expand our integrated renewable energy value chain that today already spans the manufacturing of every major component required for green energy generation,\" he said.The coal-to-ports group wants to produce the \"world's least expensive green electron\" that will become the feedstock for several sectors that must meet the sustainability mandate.\"And to make this happen, we are already building the world's largest single-site renewable energy park in Khavda, in the district of Kutch (in Gujarat). Just this single location will generate 30 GW of power, thereby taking our total renewable energy capacity to 50 GW by 2030,\" he said.Adani said the energy transition space will fundamentally change the global energy landscape forever. \"The global transition market was valued at approximately USD 3 trillion in 2023 and is expected to grow to nearly USD 6 trillion by 2030, and thereafter double every 10 years till 2050.\"\"As many of you know, in the case of India, our country aims to install 500 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity by 2030. This ambitious target will require annual investments of over USD 150 billion dollars. The transition to green energy in India is expected to generate millions of new jobs in sectors such as solar and wind, energy storage, hydrogen and its derivatives, EV charging stations, as well as grid infrastructure development,\" he said.On digital infrastructure, he said data is indeed the new oil and at the heart of all the action is the Data Centre - the critical infrastructure needed to power all forms of computational needs, especially AI workloads for machine learning algorithms, natural language processing, computer vision, and deep learning.All of this is dependent on the ability to process data at an unprecedented speed and scale which are the precise capabilities that data centres provide. However, this will need massive amounts of energy, making the data centre business the largest energy consuming industry in the world, he said.\"This makes the energy transition even more complex and is raising electricity prices, thereby adding to the already high prices because of the combined impact of climate change and demand growth,\" Adani said.The billionaire said the infrastructure required for energy transition and the infrastructure required for digital transformation are now inseparable as the technology sector becomes the largest consumer of the precious green electrons.Adani group's digital footprint will span industrial clouds across each of its businesses that it will productize and then take to market, operational technology cybersecurity offerings, super apps to leverage its B2C businesses across wide variety of consumer facing businesses, Artificial Intelligence labs to capitalize on India's fast emerging expertise to provide AI services to the world, and Data Centres that will form the backbone of the energy intensive digital revolution.\"In fact, it is anticipated that by the year 2030, the world will need 100 to 150 GW of additional green energy just for the AI data centres. We already have India's largest order book for data centres and are now in discussions for additional gigawatt-scale green AI data centres which we are uniquely positioned to deliver,\" he said.\n       ",
