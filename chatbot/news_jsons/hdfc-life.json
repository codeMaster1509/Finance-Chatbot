    "This December will be \"highly significant\" for the overall growth of the life insurance industry this fiscal, according to analysts at Emkay Global Financial Services.They expect retail annual premium equivalent (APE) to grow at 6-7 percent year-on-year (YoY) in FY24, led by private sector growth of 11-12 percent and LIC's \"low single-digit growth\".Also read:\u00a0LIC as an investor is key to its profitability as an insurerThe last month of the year is typically key for the industry but this year's December will be particularly important because the industry is likely to see a decline in March 2024, which will weigh on the overall annual growth.In their latest report, the analysts wrote \"as the industry moves past the festive disruption (in November 2023) as well as December typically being the key month (11-12\u00a0percent of annual retail APE), growth in Dec-23 will be highly significant for overall FY24 growth \u2014 this is owing to the industry likely to a decline in Mar-24 on account of an extremely high base of Mar-23 due to preponement of the large ticket, non-linked policy buying, post taxation changes in Budget-2023. We expect retail APE in FY24 to grow at 6-7\u00a0percent, led by private sector growth of 11-12\u00a0percent and LIC\u2019s low single-digit growth\".This November's growth was muted, with a 3.8 percent year-on-year (YoY) decline in retail APE, because of the higher base in November 2022, said the analysts.This November saw the disruptions from Diwali spending while November 2022 came after Diwali. In the month, the decline seen by private players was lower, noted the report.It stated, \"Private players logged a minor dip of 1.3\u00a0percent YoY while LIC posted a sharper 8.7 percent drop in Retail APE, during Nov 23.\"In November 2022, \"The industry saw strong Retail APE growth of 22 percent (private sector: 27 percent; LIC: 13 percent) bolstered by Diwali festivity disruption occurring earlier in Oct-22 and some players running distribution incentive programs... in the month\".Overall, the analysts find the valuations of life insurers attractive and maintain a preference for SBI Life, Max Financial and HDFC Life.They wrote, \"The sustained growth delivery by private life insurers addresses the overstated concerns on growth post the taxation changes on high-ticket, non-linked products.\"\u00a0Budget 2023 had removed tax exemption for insurance policies with premium over Rs 5 lakh.Also read:\u00a0Budget 2023: Tax exemption removed in insurance policies with premium over Rs 5 lakhEmkay's analysts added, \"With the margin compression story already played out in FY24, private life insurers are on track to deliver robust VNB (value of new business) growth in FY25 & beyond.\"\n       ",

As the level of awareness is on the rise, we will see more and more customised products.

    "In investing, what is comfortable is rarely profitable\u00a0- Robert ArnottNo official announcement by the stock exchanges, but the market is convinced that LTI Mindtree will be the replacement for HDFC in the benchmarks Nifty and Sensex. That partly explains the flurry of activity in the call options for the July series. Usually, it is a flavour of the season stock from a fancied sector that finds its way into benchmark indices.Like its peers in the IT space, LTI Mindtree too had a middling run over the last year as the consensus view is that the IT sector will struggle because of the slowdown in the US. This is one of the rare instances when a new entrant in the index (if it comes to that) could increase the weightage of a sector that is right now not in favour with investors.Open interest in the 5,200 strike call options in LTI Mindtree for the July series has rocketed. The demand for the options is coming from those who are betting on the stock being included in the Nifty, thus attracting inflows from passively managed funds. The rise in premia over the last week has, however, been modest, indicating that there are enough traders willing to bet that the fundamental picture will limit big upside in the stock.HDFC LifeThe stock was among the big gainers on Tuesday, as parent HDFC bought 1.49 crore shares through a block deal and is said to need another 1.4 crore shares of to increase its ownership to over 50 percent. HDFC Life shareshave risen 44 percent from their March lows, and has clearly been the star performer among insurance companies stocks over the last three months. But much of that has been driven by technical factors\u00a0like HDFC increasing its stake in the company. In addition, the exit of co-promoter Abrdn through open market block deals has removed a major overhang in the stock.\u00a0 There could be some more steam left as HDFC looks to buy the remaining shares to go above the 50 percent mark. That will then put the focus back on the fundamental side of the story. The market is still divided on the prospects of life insurers at this point. HDFC Life shares hit a peak of around 750 in September 2021, but have been struggling ever since.Heavy metalThe metal space sees a divergence now. Spot aluminium and zinc prices have softened month-on-month, compared with\u00a0lead and copper, weighed down by recession concerns in the West, a marginally weaker dollar index, and lesser-than-anticipated domestic growth in China.That said, aluminum, zinc and lead are expected to remain balanced/ in slight deficit globally impacted by restricted supply.Aluminum prices, in particular, are expected to be supported by restricted supply, lower inventory levels, and the global cost curve.\u201cLower costs (thermal coal, caustic soda and crude derivatives have softened) and steady demand will aid domestic non-ferrous companies,\u201d analysts at Antique Stock Broking said.Blowing hot, Blowing coldThe sailor curses the rain the farmer prays for. A similar dynamic is at work in the air-conditioner market.AC industry growth is expected to fall short of expectations in Q1 FY24 due to the erratic weather conditions, Dolat Capital says in a note. Companies like Voltas, Blue Star and Lloyd, which have already posted lacklustre sales in the March quarter of FY23 due to the freakishly cool onset of summer, are likely to register flat-to-mid single-digit revenue increase on an unfavourable base.Although raw material prices are easing, margins will be impacted due to elevated advertising spends amid highly competitive intensity.\u00a0 However, weather gods may not be as kind in the coming years. Coupled with the growing economy and disposable incomes, this means AC sales can only go in one direction. So long term investors can take heart.\u201cGiven low AC penetration (7-9\u00a0percent), harsh summer, growing disposable income, rise in residential and commercial projects and consumer finance options, India\u2019s AC industry offers bright prospects in the medium to long term,\u201d Dolat added.Recession chatterThe US is likely to slip into recession in the fourth quarter this year, and the economic weakness is likely to persist in 2024, according to HSBC Asset Management. The euro zone is not far behind and could be in a similar position in 2024. But HSBC analysts have some good news as well: inflation will fall quickly, and the Federal Reserve will cut rates by the end of this year.Home pricesHome prices in US saw their first year-over-year erosion in 11 years in April, as measured by the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller National Home Price Index. Higher mortgage rates have made home purchases more expensive for buyers, causing a slowdown in home sales, reports WSJ.But prices haven\u2019t declined as much as many economists had thought, because the higher mortgage rates made current homeowners reluctant to sell, keeping the supply of homes on the market lower than normal.Slowing shaleSofter oil and natural gas prices and rising costs are squeezing the profit margins in the US shale patch, where the business activity growth stalled in the second quarter of the year, according to a report by mining.com.\u201cWith oil and gas prices currently lower than at this time last year, drilling activity is slowing down and could further slow amid uncertainties about the economy and the Administration's policies towards the industry.\u00a0 US shale producers are no longer the world's swing producers as they are not boosting drilling activity too much, even when oil prices surge.\u201dDr CopperLondon Metal Exchange copper stocks have slid from 100,100 tonnes to 77,050 over the last three weeks, despite almost 30,000 tonnes of arrivals, writes Reuters columnist and copper expert Andy Home.

    "Private life insurance companies are expected to continue their strong growth momentum this fiscal, though margins may remain under pressure as the focus shifts to higher distributor payouts and investments in stepping up new channels, analysts say. Life insurers posted healthy growth in annualised premium equivalent (APE) in the fourth quarter of FY23, aided by customers rushing to buy high-ticket, non-unit-linked savings products ahead of withdrawal of tax exemptions from April 1.APE is a common measure of ascertaining the business sales in the life insurance industry.The Union Budget 2023-24 withdrew tax exemptions on maturity proceeds of non-unit linked insurance policies (non-ULIPs) with an annual premium exceeding Rs 5 lakh.\u201cWhile the Street remains skeptical, we expect private life insurance companies under coverage to deliver 13-18 percent APE growth on normalised basis. The one-off business in March 2023 will likely weigh on March 2024, leading to 2-18 percent APE growth for the year,\u201d Kotak Institutional Equities said in a report.Life insurance companies will likely lose business in non-participating policies (where the profits are not shared and no dividends are paid to policyholders) above annual premium of Rs 5 lakh, though policies below this threshold may become relatively more attractive as income from these policies remains tax-free, while income from debt funds has been made taxable at the marginal tax rate.Margin PressuresChallenges on the margins front may impact life insurers in the near term, feel analysts.\u201cInvestments in new partnerships and income in agency business will likely put pressure on margin expansion. Levers include pick-up in term business and the high share of non-part (policies). We consequently model flat-to-marginal compression in margins in FY 2024E for listed private insurance companies; this is compared with the 145 bps to 981 bps expansion reported in FY2021-23,\u201d Kotak added.As per new rules by IRDAI effective April 1, life and general insurance companies will not have to adhere to any specific ceiling on commissions paid to agents, distributor banks, and other intermediaries.Also Read:\u00a0Higher insurance agent commissions to continue, but IRDAI asks insurers to adhere to EoM capsHowever, the payouts cannot exceed the overall expenses of management (EoM) limits specified by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI).The industry has largely welcomed the regulator\u2019s directives, though some smaller players said they could find the going tough in the days to come.Some analysts also believe that the larger listed players will be under pressure to deliver as unlisted insurers now have the flexibility to be more aggressive.\u201cThis removal of explicit commission cap will bring in transparency and payouts to distributors will get reported under commissions. For listed larger players, despite commission limits being freed up, the struggle to deliver profitability to the shareholders while balancing policyholders and distributors' interests would mean the limited ability to materially tinker the payouts to their distributors,\u201d broking firm Emkay Global said in a recent report.Road AheadDespite these headwinds, Kotak has retained its positive stance on the life insurance sector.\u201cWe expect APE growth (ex-one offs in March) to remain strong in FY2024E, with flat margins, but investments provide visibility for better medium-term growth. Non-par savings and protection will be value drivers. We remain bullish across life insurers,\u201d it noted.However, there are also some voices of concern.HDFC Securities said conversations with industry experts suggest that the top four private life insurers are likely to witness 20-27 percent adverse impact on FY24E APE, predominantly on account of the impending transition to the new tax regime.The optional new tax regime has removed most deductions, including on life insurance premiums.Policies with a ticket size of less than Rs 1 lakh are believed to be sensitive to tax deductions under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, analysts at HDFC Securities noted.\u201cWe expect an 18/11/16 percent impact on retail APE of SBI Life/ICICI Prudential/Max Life solely on the back of lower new business growth as customers move to a new tax regime (assuming resistance from 40 percent of the 80C sensitive customer pool),\u201d they said.While HDFC Securities is constructive on the long-term prospects of the life insurance industry and the regulatory vision to improve penetration, it said the sector will face growth challenges in the near- to medium-term from revised EoM guidelines, the gradual elimination of tax-induced sales, increasing competition within channels, and forced pivot towards lower ticket-sized policies.It\u2019s advice to players in the segment?\u201cWe believe India is structurally moving towards a regime where \u2018tax planning\u2019 as a motivation for insurance will become completely redundant. Hence, companies that pivot sooner from \u2018tax planning\u2019 to the \u2018financial planning\u2019 plank will have a competitive advantage over peers,\u201d it added.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
