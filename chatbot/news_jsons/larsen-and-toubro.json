    "Indian engineering research and development services provider L&T Technology Services cut its revenue growth forecast for the current financial year on Tuesday, citing longer deal decision cycles and macroeconomic challenges.The unit of engineering conglomerate Larsen and Toubro now expects revenue in dollars for this fiscal year ending March to grow 17.5%-18.5% in constant currency, as opposed to the previous estimate of a 20% jump.\u201dWhile longer term trends for ER&D remain strong, in the short term we are seeing longer decision cycles and incremental headwinds from the macro-economic stress in various geographies,\u201d CEO Amit Chadha said in a statement.L&T Technology follows larger IT service providers Infosys and HCLTech, which last week cut revenue outlook after clients in major revenue-generating markets of the U.S. and Europe scaled back spending amid fears of an economic slowdown.L&T Technology, however, reported consolidated net profit for the second quarter at 3.15 billion rupees ($37.85 million), up from 3 billion rupees a year ago.During the quarter, the company won seven deals worth more than $10 million each across all industry segments, it said in a filing.Revenue from operations climbed 4.6% to 23.87 billion rupees in the quarter, led by a 15% rise in revenue in its mainstay transportation segment.The company restated year-ago figures to incorporate results of Smart World and Communication, a business it purchased from its parent earlier this year.L&T Technology\u2019s shares closed down 1.6% lower ahead of the results.

    "Larsen & Toubro Ltd (L&T), a prominent engineering and infrastructure conglomerate, is set to kickstart its equity share buyback program on September 18. The last date for tendering shares or closing of the buyback will take place on September 25.Larsen & Toubro announced a Rs 10,000 crore share buyback along with its June quarter results in July. The tender offer buyback was supposed to be carried out at a price of Rs 3,000 per share but the\u00a0company announced on September 11 that it has increased the buyback price to Rs 3,200 per equity share.Catch all the market updates LIVER Shankar Raman, L&T's CFO and whole-time director, emphasized the company's commitment to improving its Return on Equity (RoE). This aligns with the central objective of the five-year strategic plan, 'Lakshya 2026,' which aims to enhance shareholder value through RoE optimization. The buyback of L&T shares is a significant step toward achieving this objective by returning capital to the shareholders.The engineering major is \u2018walking the talk\u2019 on its RoE focus with a buyback price of Rs 3,200 per share, pointed out foreign brokerage firm CLSA.The EPC major anticipates that the buyback will have minimal effect on its profitability and earnings, except for reducing the funds available for investment, which could have otherwise been used to generate investment income.Under the buyback regulations, a promoter can choose to participate in a buyback. However, since L&T is professionally managed and lacks identifiable promoters or a promoter group in control, the disclosure of promoter intentions, current holdings as of the Public Announcement date, and trading details for the past 12 months is not relevant, the company said.The financing for the planned buyback will come from the company's free reserves (retained earnings), current cash and cash equivalents, and/or internal earnings, as well as any other permissible source according to the Buyback Regulations or the Act.L&T is a professionally managed conglomerate valued at $23 billion. Founded in Mumbai in 1946 by Danish engineers Henning Holck-Larsen and Soren Kristian Toubro, the company operates in sectors including EPC projects, hi-tech manufacturing and services.

We believe, L&T to comfortably surpass its order inflows guidance of 10-12% growth for FY24 (~Rs2.3trn in FY23) aided by large international and domestic order wins.

Also, till date in FY24, L&T has announced orders worth over INR 750bn. With this significant accretion in orders, L&T could report >20% growth in order inflow in Q2 (excl. services), in our view. Note L&T has highlighted that order prospects have improved QoQ (for the first time on prospects from the Middle East hydrocarbons). However, it has maintained its order inflow growth guidance of 15% YoY for FY24. Given the order inflow including the above mentioned order, we expect L&T to beat its earlier order inflow guidance. Also, we like the renewed focus of L&T to reward minority shareholders with a significant buyback announced in Q1FY24. We believe RoE is likely to improve by 200bps in the medium term. We raise FY25E PAT and also increase target multiple for the standalone business. Upgrade to BUY.OutlookWe upgrade the stock to BUY on strong consecutive order inflow for two quarters (Q1, Q2FY24), which could likely result in beat to order inflow guidance for FY24, a significant buyback to reward shareholders and consequent improvement in RoE.

    "India's biggest engineering company, Larsen & Toubro (L&T), plans to give back extra money to its shareholders by repurchasing up to Rs 10,000 crore worth of shares through a buyback.The engineering conglomerate\u2019s board has approved the proposal to buy back 3.33 crore shares, representing 2.4 percent of the total paid-up equity share capital, at a tentative price of Rs 3,000 per share, which is the maximum being considered by L&T at the moment. The offer represents an over-17 percent premium to the July 25 closing price of Rs 2,561.95.Once the shareholder's approval for the buyback is received, L&T will decide on a date and the final price, the infrastructure giant\u2019s Chief Financial Officer R Shankar Raman\u00a0said in a post-earnings conference call with the media.Boost returns?The buyback is part of L&T's plan to improve its Return on Equity (RoE) as part of the group's 'Lakshya 2026' plan, Raman added.According to an analyst from a foreign brokerage firm, the buyback is expected to boost L&T's Earnings per share (EPS) and Return on Equity (RoE). The analyst foresees a potential enhancement of RoE by 40-60 basis points (bps), while EPS could see a slight upward revision of merely 4-5 percent.When a company buys back its own stock, it reduces the number of outstanding shares. As a result, the company's earnings are divided among fewer shares, which automatically increases its EPS. The return on equity would also improve because there is less outstanding equity.\u201cThis (buyback) will likely help the company achieve its strategic target of 18 percent RoE by FY25-26,\u201d said ICICI Securities.Even Nuvama Institutional Equities believes the buyback is a positive surprise.The conglomerate\u2019s decision indicates its confidence in the future growth, and the perception that its stock is undervalued, pointed out Sonam Srivastava, Founder and Fund Manager at Wright Research.\u201cThis may buoy the stock price in the short-term, but in the long-term its performance will be dictated by its\u00a0capital allocation policy. If the company is able to deploy capital to drive higher growth and better quality of earnings, the stock will see good compounded growth,\u201d she said.As on June 30, 2023, L&T's cash-on-books stood at around Rs 40,000-45,000 crore on a consolidated basis.Brokerage commentaryThe buyback has largely been factored in the stock price. What would now carry the stock higher or make it ripe for re-rating is the divestment of non-core assets such as the Hyderabad Metro\u00a0or Nabha Power.Kotak Institutional Equities is of the view that L&T\u2019s stock is expensive given its 28 times and 23 times its one- and two-year forward earnings.However, Prabhudas Lilladher is optimistic about the engineering major's prospects. It believes L&T is well-placed to benefit in the long term due to several factors, including strong tender opportunities, improved domestic order conversion, a notable increase in hydrocarbon and renewable energy orders from international markets like Saudi Arabia, and an anticipated rise in private investment in the domestic market.The EPC major registered an order inflow of Rs 65,500 crore, up 57 percent year-on-year (YoY) in Q1 FY24, taking the order book as of June-end 2023 to an all-time high of Rs 4.1 trillion, which is around 2.3 times its FY22-23 revenue. The domestic market accounts for 71 percent of this, the rest being international business.Management commentaryThe management has maintained sales growth guidance of 12-15 percent and an order inflow growth target of 10-12 percent.Raman had said during the conference call that L&T is likely to meet the higher end of its revenue and order inflow guidance for 2023-24, and may consider revising its guidance for both revenue and operating margin after the October-December 2023 quarter.He said that L&T's order inflow is likely to taper towards the second half of 2023-24 due to the upcoming general election in India between April and May 2024.\"We will have to be wary of a slowdown in order inflow due to the upcoming general election and plans of the subsequent government that may take over,\" Raman said.\n       ",
