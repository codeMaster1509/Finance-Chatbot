    "The Narendra Modi government remains committed to privatising two state-owned banks and one general insurer. However, these deals are unlikely to take place in this financial year,\u00a0Moneycontrol\u00a0has learnt from informed sources.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, while presenting the 2021-22 Union Budget, had said that the privatisation of the three entities would be carried out this year.\u201cOther than IDBI Bank, we propose to take up the privatisation of two public sector banks and one general insurance company in the year 2021-22,\u201d Sitharaman had said.However, the government now plans to privatise these companies in 2022-23, a top official said.\u201cThis process is about the privatisation of state-owned financial companies, a new territory in terms of policy and a reversal of bank nationalisation. Also, the finance minister has promised there will be no job losses as a result of privatisation. Framing the contours of the deal and finding a suitable buyer will take time,\u201d the official said.Sources confirmed that Central Bank of India and Indian Overseas Bank had been shortlisted for privatisation. The insurance company, as yet unidentified, could be one among National Insurance, United India Insurance and Oriental Insurance.Additionally, the Centre is confident that the ambitious divestment target of Rs 1.75 lakh crore this financial year will be met through share sales in Air India, Bharat Petroleum, Shipping Corporation of India, Container Corporation of India, Pawan Hans, BEML, Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd., and IDBI Bank, as well as the listing of Life Insurance Corporation of India, which is expected to be the country\u2019s largest initial public offering.Long process aheadThe official said the process of privatising the two banks and the insurance company will be a long one, especially given that the government must find suitable buyers to ensure that no downsizing takes place in the two lenders.As shown in the attached chart, after the names are finalised, the proposal will be finetuned by a group of secretaries led by the Cabinet Secretary. It will then go to an empowered group of ministers before submission to the Union Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Acts of 1970 and 1980 and the Banking Regulation Act will have to be amended. While work to bring about the legislative changes has started, the amendments have not been scheduled to be tabled in the ongoing monsoon session of parliament.After the Cabinet\u2019s approval, the finance ministry\u2019s Department of Investment and Public Asset Management will begin appointing transaction and legal advisors. The selected advisors will then help the government take forward the process of finding suitable buyers.\u201cThis process will be carried out very carefully. The finance minister has promised no job losses and that promise will be kept,\u201d a second official said.Even as bank employee unions threaten to go on strike over the privatisation plans, Sitharaman had said in March that no banks would be closed down and all steps will be taken to safeguard the interests of the staff in terms of salaries and pensions.Govt to move ahead with pending plansThe plans to privatise Air India, Bharat Petroleum, Shipping Corporation and Container Corporation have been pending since 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant economic slowdown have put a spanner in the works. However, this also means that a lot of background work has already been done regarding these privatisation candidates.\u201cLast year and this year, we have already done a lot of work towards fructifying these plans. In many cases, the transaction and legal advisors have been appointed or are in the process of being appointed. We are confident that the target of Rs 1.75 lakh crore will be met,\u201d said the second official.Last week,\u00a0the Centre issued requests for proposals for the appointment of the book-running lead managers, legal advisors, share transfer agents and advertising agents\u00a0for the planned LIC share sale. The size of the IPO is expected to be larger than ever before in the Indian markets.\u201cIt is the endeavour of the government to attract investment from institutional investors, both domestic and global, in addition to retail investors,\u201d DIPAM had said.The Cabinet had also approved allowing the government and LIC to shed their 100 percent stake in IDBI Bank. The Reserve Bank of India does not consider IDBI Bank a state-owned lender because its majority shareholder is LIC and not the Central government.\n       ",
    "US-based IT major Accenture and India\u2019s oil and gas firm Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) have partnered for digitally transforming the latter's sales and distribution network.For this purpose Accenture will use data, artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud technologies to build, design and implement a digital platform IRIS, the company said in a statement.The platform will integrate real-time data from across BPCL\u2019s countrywide network, including more than 18,000 fuel retail outlets, 25,000 tank trucks, 75 oil installations and depots, 52 liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) bottling plants and 250 additional industrial and commercial locations, to provide a consolidated view of its extensive operations.The IRIS platform will subsequently trigger automated alerts and actions, including rapid response to equipment failures or hazardous situations.According to the statement, it will also empower the BPCL workforce of more than 100,000 across the country to make faster and more accurate decisions, including preventative maintenance. This can help increase sales at fuel retail outlets by minimizing infrastructure downtime and ensuring consistent fuel quality, as well as improve the experience for customers.The new platform will be able to accept more than three million inputs per second from automated sensors, cameras and Internet of Things (IoT) devices deployed at all key locations, tracking performance based on key parameters such as fuel stock, safety, compliance, and equipment health.Arun Kumar Singh, Director (Marketing) and Director (Refineries), BPCL, said in the statement, \u201cDigital transformation opens up new opportunities for the oil and gas industry. As an organization passionate about embracing change and leading the charge, we look forward to leveraging technology to unlock tremendous value, sustainable growth, and improved efficiency.\u201d\u201cWith the deployment of this highly automated command and control platform called IRIS, we will not only bolster our digital capabilities significantly, but also improve customer experience and transform operations at scale. It will further ensure consistent and uniform delivery of BPCL\u2019s brand promises of innovation, care and reliability to our customers,\u201d said Rahul Tandon, Head, Digital Transformation, BPCL, in the statement.\n       ",
    "Of all the companies and assets up for divestment in FY22, the Narendra Modi government expects to begin its privatisation programme with the two biggest marquee names \u2013 Bharat Petroleum (BPCL) and Air India.In fact, the finance ministry\u2019s Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM), the nodal body for divestment, is confident that the privatisation of BPCL and Air India can be completed by June-July 2021, Moneycontrol has learnt.\u201cThe (privatisation) processes of Air India and BPCL are at a more advanced stage compared to other names, hence these will be the first off the blocks. We are targeting late-first quarter, early-second quarter to complete these deals,\u201d a top government official said.However, while the Centre is confident of being able to finally go big on privatisation after years of delays, there are some headwinds expected. The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, RSS affiliate, has planned a phased nationwide agitation against the government's privatisation drive. The agitation is expected to go on from mid-March to mid-November.\"This is a matter for the political leadership to deal with. The top leadership in the government has given us its full backing to complete the privatisation plans,\" said the official.In her Union Budget 2021-22 speech on February 1, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had set an ambitious divestment target of Rs 1.75 crore. Unlike in the past, when the divestment pipeline leaned towards initial public offerings (IPO), offers for sale, mergers between two state-owned companies and share buybacks, the FY22 pipeline will hinge upon privatisation and asset sales.Out of the Rs 1.75 lakh crore, Rs 75,000 crore is expected to come from the privatisation of state-owned companies, while Rs 1 lakh crore is expected to come from the sale of state-owned financial entities and the planned IPO of LIC Ltd, according to budget documents.Officials, however, say this break-up of the coming year\u2019s target is just on paper and rather fungible, with the aim being to achieve the headline number.\u201cOnce we have achieved some of the key transactions that we have taken forward now, like BPCL and others, these will be the first privatisations that could take place,\u201d DIPAM Secretary Tuhin Kanta Pandey had told Moneycontrol in a post-budget interview.The government is learnt to have been encouraged by the interest received from prospective buyers for the two companies. For BPCL, expressions of interest (EOIs) are learnt to have been received from Vedanta Resources PLC, Apollo Global and ISquared Capital. In case of Air India, Ajay Singh of SpiceJet, Tatas, and Pawan Ruia of Ruia Group are learnt to have submitted physical EOIs.A grouping of investment company Interups Inc and a consortium of Air India employees were also interested in bidding for the national carrier. However, Interups backed out of the bidding process.Air India, BPCL and other candidates like Concor and Shipping Corp were part of the Centre\u2019s FY21 divestment plan, and so was the LIC IPO. However, the COVID-19 pandemic put those plans on ice, and the government is hopeful that these long-pending plans can bear fruit.The privatisation of Pawan Hans, NINL Ltd, two un-named state-owned banks and one un-named state-owned general insurance company is also part of the pipeline for FY22.\n       ",
    "Privatisation-bound Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) will buy out Oman Oil Company's shares in Bina refinery project in the next 10 days, and is hoping to complete a separate sale of its stake in Numaligarh Refinery by the next month-end, its director-finance said on Tuesday. BPCL holds a 63.68 per cent stake in Bharat Oman Refineries Ltd (BORL), which built and operates a 7.8 million tonne oil refinery at Bina in Madhya Pradesh.\"Discussions (to acquire 36.62 per cent stake of OQ S.A.O.C) have concluded. We can come out with an announcement of the acquisition of the stake in next 10 days or so,\" BPCL Director (Finance) N Vijayagopal told reporters on an earnings call. OQ S.A.O.C. was formerly known as Oman Oil Company.Without giving details, he said the deal details such as acquisition price will form part of the announcement likely in the next 10 days. BORL was incorporated in February 1994 to build a refinery at Bina in Madhya Pradesh. The unit initially could turn 6 million tonnes of crude oil annually into fuel, which was subsequently raised to 7.8 million tonnes.Before the company is privatised, BPCL will exit Numaligarh Refinery Ltd (NRL) by selling its 61.65 per cent stake to a consortium of Oil India Ltd and Engineers India Ltd, Vijayagopal said. It is selling stake because the government had as per the Assam Peace Accord, agreed to keep NRL in the public sector.Also Read:\u00a0Oil India to pick up BPCL stake in Numaligarh refinery this fiscal\"The consortium of OIL and Engineers India Ltd will acquire 49 per cent and the rest 13.65 per cent will be sold to the government of Assam,\" he said, adding the company board at its meeting on Monday approved the share purchase agreement. OIL currently holds 26 per cent equity in NRL, while the government of Assam has around 12.35 per cent.The value for 61.65 per cent stake in NRL is reportedly around Rs 7,000 crore. \"NRL stake sale is happening at a rapid pace,\" he said. \"Valuation is being done by valuers and if things go as planned, the transaction will be completed by March 31.\" \"NRL stake sale is happening at a rapid pace,\" he said.The completion of the transaction is subject to the deal getting requisite government approvals, he noted. Post NRL sale, BPCL would be left with three refineries at Mumbai, Kochi in Kerala and Bina.The government is selling its entire 52.98 per cent stake in BPCL in the nation's biggest privatisation till date. Vedanta Group and private equity firms Apollo Global and I Squared Capital's Indian unit Think Gas have put in an expression of interest for buying the government stake.\u00a0 gThe sale of NRL is the first step towards the disinvestment of BPCL. The government has already indicated that it expects to complete BPCL privatisation by the first half of the fiscal beginning April (2021-22).The sale is key to achieving the Rs 1.75 lakh crore disinvestment target set for 2021-22. BPCL will give the buyer ownership of around 15.33 per cent of India's oil refining capacity and 22 per cent of the fuel marketing share. BPCL will give the buyer ownership of around 15.33 per cent of India's oil refining capacity and 22 per cent of the fuel marketing share.NRL is looking to expand its refining capacity from 3 million tonnes per annum to 9 million tonnes a year at an investment of Rs 22,594 crore. The project is expected to be completed by 2024. The expansion also involves setting up of crude oil pipeline from Paradip in Odisha to Numaligarh and a product pipeline from Numaligarh to Siliguri in West Bengal.

    "It was February 1, 2020. As part of her budget, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the highest-ever divestment target of Rs 2.1 lakh crore, Rs 1.1 lakh crore more than the highest achieved divestment receipt of Rs 1 lakh crore in 2017-18. This was the time when the COVID-19 pandemic had just come to Indian shores through travellers returning from China and Europe. The nationwide lockdown was still nearly two months away.Even the highly ambitious target for 2020-21 was considered achievable. Sitharaman had announced the planned initial public offering (IPO) of public sector behemoth Life Insurance Corporation of India. The cabinet had also cleared the privatisation of Bharat Petroleum, Container Corp and Shipping Corp in November 2019. These, along with Air India, were expected to be completed in the current financial year.That did not happen, and the reasons are well documented. Investors and potential buyers around the globe went into a mode of saving their financial firepower, as the pandemic crippled economies, including India.Nearly a year later, the Finance Minister is again expected to announce a massive divestment target, with the same five companies (four privatisation and one mega-IPO) expected to form a bulk of the plans.PrivatisationWhen Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014, he had made it clear that his administration would be pro-privatisation,\u00a0in line with most economic right of centre governments around the world. It has been six years and the only sales of state-owned companies that have taken place at that time have been to other state-owned companies.To be fair, the time taken to come up with a comprehensive privatisation plan is understandable. Governments, whether centre or states, are loath to let go of their PSUs and line ministries consider the PSUs their crown jewels or private fiefdom, depending on the way you look at it.Officials from Niti Aayog and the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management, the two departments most deeply involved in the divestment process, admit to the long and sometimes difficult negotiations that take place to convince a ministry that their PSU will be privatised. The deciding factor has been the unwavering support for privatisation at PMO.DIPAM has already received expressions of interest for Air India and BPCL, and the government seems confident that it can close both the deals in the first half of the coming year. Same goes for Shipping Corp, whose EOIs have been invited recently. Only Concor\u2019s EOI is yet to be put into place. The centre has also revived the privatisation plans of Pawan Hans and will also put on the block Nilanchal Ispat Nigam Ltd.Market OfferingsAs a sustained bull run continued in the Indian markets the past few months, the government was criticised by notable economists, including former Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan. Rajan said earlier this month that given the levels markets were at, the centre should go for more share sales.In January itself, the centre has carried out the IPO of IRFC Ltd and offer for sale for SAIL Ltd. Other IPOs and OFSs being planned for the remainder of this fiscal year and the next fiscal year include Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers, RVNL, BEML Ltd, Midhani Ltd, Telecommunications Consultants India Ltd, among others.The biggest, however, will be the IPO of LIC Ltd. The centre has appointed an actuary who will calculate the valuation and implied book value of the insurance giant. Given the size of the company and complexity of its holdings, it is a process that the government does not expect to be completed before the second quarter of 2021-22.\n       ",
    "Divestment-bound Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) is in advanced stages of discussions to acquire Oman's state-owned oil company OQ's stake in Bina refinery project in Madhya Pradesh for around Rs 1,900-2,000 crore,\u00a0 Moneycontrol\u00a0has learnt.According to a source close to the development, the deal is likely to happen before the privatisation of BPCL. The company plans to merge Bina refinery, also known as Bharat Oman Refineries (BORL), with itself. This is expected to raise the valuation of BPCL in the ongoing privatisation process and also provide tax advantage in selling petroleum products.According to BPCL annual report, BPCL has given a loan of Rs 1,254.10 crore to BORL and subscribed to share warrants of Rs 935.68 crore. BPCL has also subscribed to zero percent compulsorily-convertible debentures of Rs 1,000 crore.The decision to buy OQ's remaining stake in the Bina Refinery was taken by BPCL's board of directors in December.BORL posted a net loss for the year 2019-20 of Rs 803.5 crore, as compared to a profit of Rs 106.71 crore during the previous year. In 2019-20, Bina refinery\u2019s crude oil intake was 7,913 thousand metric tonnes (TMT) with average capacity utilization of 95 per cent.The talks for buying Oman\u2019s stake comes at a time when the government is looking to offload its entire stake in BPCL. The Centre's 52.98 percent stake in BPCL is valued at around Rs 47,000 crore based on the current market cap.Three potential bidders, including Vedanta Group and two private equity funds -- Apollo Global and I Squared Capital --have also expressed interest in BPCL.",
    "More than a year after approval by Cabinet, the centre has invited expressions of interest for the privatisation of state-owned Shipping Corporation of India. The centre plans to offload its entire 63.75 percent stake and management control in the company.The Finance Ministry\u2019s Department of Investment and Public Asset Management aims to complete the transaction in the first half of the fiscal year 2021-22, informed sources told Moneycontrol. As per the preliminary information memorandum, the last date of submission of EOIs by interested bidders is February 13, 2021.As per the eligibility criteria, Indian as well as foreign companies, and alternative investment funds (AIFs) can bid for Shipping Corp.\u00a0Other state-owned enterprises can also participate in the bid process. There seem to be no restrictions on whether prospective buyers should have previous experience in the maritime industry or not.As per the PIM, the publicly-listed Shipping Corp has a fleet of 59 ships, including container vessels, dry bulk carriers, very large crude carriers, offshore supply vessels and others. Based on the company's share price in early trade on December 22, the centre\u2019s 63.75 percent is valued at Rs 2,521 crore.The centre would, of course, like a healthy premium on its stake. However, the PIM itself contains the risks and headwinds to the shipping industry due to Covid-19.\u201cWith the given forecast on economic activity, seaborne trade, which is directly linked with economic activity may also see a decline. However, given the divergent dynamics of the shipping industry, things may well take a different course during different time periods,\u201d the PIM said. It added that China\u2019s increasing ore production and spiking prices in the tanker segment constitute a \u2018silver lining\u2019 for the industry.As per the PIM, the short term implications for marine trade include a slowdown of major ports and delay of cargo leading to accumulations concerns, reduced demand for shipping and cargo turnovers and financial challenges for ship owners following the fall in demand for shipping.The Union Cabinet had given approval for the privatisation of Shipping Corp, Bharat Petroleum and Container Corp in November last year. Shipping Corp\u2019s privatisation was very much on DIPAM\u2019s agenda for this year, along with the companies mentioned above, and Air India, as it sought to meet the highest ever divestment target of Rs 2.1 lakh crore.However, the Covid-19 pandemic and the nationwide lockdown in the first quarter of the fiscal year put paid to any chances of meeting that target, even as the last date for Bharat Petroleum and Air India EOIs kept on being extended multiple times.\n       ",
    "What a difference a year can make!In late-November 2019, as the Union Cabinet had cleared the privatisation of Bharat Petroleum, along with other state-owned companies like Concor and Shipping Corp, there was much optimism in the government regarding what could have been a blockbuster deal.Around the time, the centre\u2019s 53.3 per cent stake in the oil marketing behemoth was valued at around Rs 59,000 crore. Internally, multiple officials in the government were hopeful of a 20-30 per cent premium, given its strong fundamentals, oil marketing network and the attractiveness of other core businesses like refining, pipeline and petrochemicals.In off-record conversations with reporters, they would speak about BPCL privatisation likely fetching the government close to Rs 80,000 crore. It was said that this was a golden opportunity for the\u00a0likes\u00a0of Saudi Aramco, Rosneft, Total and Exxon Mobil to tap the huge Indian retail market for petroleum products.A global pandemic and an economic slowdown later, things don\u2019t look quite so rosy. And though the government has said it has received a number of expressions of interest and will not extend the dates for submitting the same, it is still some time before clarity emerges on whether a deal to privatise BPCL can be finalised or not.\u201cThough we have moved on to the next stage, there is still some way to go before a buyer can be identified. The privatisation certainly won\u2019t happen this fiscal year,\u201d a senior government official told MoneycontrolOn November 17, BPCL shares closed 4.4 percent lower. That would value the centre\u2019s 53 per cent stake at around Rs 45,000 crore. And this time around, officials aren\u2019t even remotely willing to hazard a guess on what sort of premium the government would get on its stake.A second official told Moneycontrol the transaction advisor Deloitte will take around 15 days to study the expressions of interest and gauge their eligibility. This will be followed by confidentiality agreements being signed with the eligible bidders and BPCL\u2019s books being opened to them. This process is expected to last 2-3 months after which bidders will place their financial bids.\u201cOnly when the interested investors place their bids will we have a sense of the enterprise value of BPCL,\u201d said the official, adding that the entire process could take upwards of six months.Moneycontrol has learnt that a number of global oil giants like Reliance, its partners Aramco, Rosneft and others have not submitted EOIs, and hence, are not interested for the time being. A PTI report had said private equity and pension funds have expressed interest in BPCL.For the eventual buyer of BPCL, around 35.3 million tonne of refining capacity, 16,492 retail outlets, and 72 million LPG customers will be on offer.The government's plan is to sell its entire shareholding in BPCL comprising 1.15 billion equity shares, with the transfer of management control to a strategic buyer, excluding the company's 61.65 per cent in the Numaligarh Refinery in Assam.The stake in Numaligarh refinery is expected to be sold to another public sector undertaking. A consortium of Oil India and Engineers India has shown interest in taking up BPCL\u2019s 48 per cent stake in Numaligarh. The remaining stake would be sold to the government of Assam, to increase the state's share to 26 per cent in the venture.\n       ",
    "The Union Cabinet, on Thursday, hiked prices of various grades of ethanol for supply to oil marketing companies, a move that will benefit sugarcane farmers and lead to higher blending of the clean fuel with conventional petroleum products.In a media briefing following the cabinet decision, Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar said that the price of sugar juice-based ethanol was being increased by Rs 3.25 per litre to Rs 62.65 per litre, that of ethanol \u2018B Heavy\u2019 was being raised to Rs 57.61 per litre, and \u2018C Heavy\u2019 ethanol will fetch Rs 45.69 per litre.\u201cThis is an increase of about Rs 2 to Rs 3.35 per litre for various grades. The GST and transportation costs will be borne by the oil marketing companies, as is the norm,\u201d Javadekar said.\u201cIn 2014, only 380 million litres of ethanol could be purchased by oil marketing companies. Last year it was 1.95 trillion litres,\u201d the minister said.The Modi government has had a long stated aim to increase ethanol blending with conventional fuels by oil marketing companies. The aim is to ensure that around 10 per cent of the total petroleum consumed in the country is blended with ethanol by 2022 and thereafter the target could be scaled up to 20 per cent blending by 2030.This was accompanied by differential prices for various grades of ethanol made from C-heavy and B-heavy molasses, sugar juice, direct sugar and from sources other than sugarcane, such as broken rice and maize as feedstock.There was also an ambitious incentive of interest subvention costing about Rs 5,000 crore to the Central government.Even then, in the 2019-20 sugarcane season that ended in September, India blended around 5.11 per cent ethanol with petrol--a far cry from the 2022 target of 10 per cent blending.News agency PTI in a recent report said that the petroleum and food ministries are of the view that ethanol production cannot be dependent on one feedstock, that is, sugarcane, for achieving the target of 20 per cent ethanol blending with petrol by 2030. There is a need to look at other agri-feedstock such as rice, maize, sorghum and barley for the purpose.India currently has 4.26 billion litres of ethanol production capacity annually while the actual ethanol produces is much lower at around 2 billion litres. When all the new production capacities come on-stream, India will start producing 5.5 billion litres.However, to achieve a 20 per cent blending target by 2030, this capacity and estimated production is inadequate as India will need around 10 billion litres of ethanol per year to meet the 20 per cent blending target.\u00a0\n       ",
    "With half of 2020-21 gone, the Centre is now picking up the pace of transactions for the remainder of the year, Tuhin Kanta Pandey, Secretary in the Department of Investment and Public Asset Management (DIPAM) told Moneycontrol in an exclusive interview. These plans include initial public offerings of RailTel, IRFC Ltd and WAPCOS Ltd.Pandey also said that the government is trying its best to complete the privatisation of Shipping Corporation, Concor Ltd, Bharat Earth Movers Ltd and Central Electronics Ltd before March 31.Some assets which the Centre also hopes to divest this year include the Nilanchal Ispat Nigam Ltd plant in Odisha, and the Salem and Bhadravathi steel plants of SAIL Ltd, he said.Besides, the government will\u00a0make another attempt at selling Pawan Hans and some subsidiaries of Air India, while Bharat Petroleum still remains the brightest and most attractive prospect. Pandey also added that it has been decided to not offer any more tranches of the two equity exchange-traded funds comprising PSU stocks, and that the Centre has very limited \u2018bandwidth\u2019 to continue supporting Air India.Excerpts:Q. The COVID pandemic has led to delays in carrying out divestment transactions, be in the markets or through strategic sales. What are your plans for initial public offerings and offers for sale in the coming months?A: We have not been shy of using the opportunities in the market, as soon as the markets\u00a0recovered.\u00a0In fact, as early as July we came out\u00a0with a bond ETF through which we\u00a0raised Rs 10,000 crore for the CPSEs, which has\u00a0come in handy in terms of not only improving sentiments, but also their capital expenditure\u00a0plans, because one of the big targets\u00a0that the Ministry of Finance has been working on and the finance minister is actually personally monitoring is the\u00a0capex plans of our CPSEs.On the equity side,\u00a0we have used\u00a0the opportunities and gone for offers-for-sale of\u00a0Hindustan Aeronautics Limited and Bharat Dynamics Ltd. In both we have almost touched the maximum shareholding requirement. In the Indian\u00a0stock market this year, we account for about 40\u00a0percent of all OFSs\u00a0in terms of value. Tuhin Kanta Pandey.Then\u00a0in the\u00a0case of Mazagon Docks initial public offering, it's been a huge success even beyond our expectations. We have other IPOs planned.\u00a0The draft red herring prospectus for the RailTel IPO has been filed with SEBI. We also have the IRFC IPO planned\u00a0which will be a big one and will be having two components.\u00a0The company\u00a0will raise\u00a0money for their own projects,\u00a0plus the government piggybacking to\u00a0sell\u00a0stake.\u00a0And some smaller companies also might be in the offing. An IPO of WAPCOS may happen if everything is in order.Our strategy is that we will not be repeatedly coming on to the market with the same stock, we are going to keep the interest of the long-term investors in mind\u00a0and\u00a0avoid the price overhang. Another\u00a0important policy decision that we have taken is that we will not do further tranches of two equity ETFs. The repeated offerings\u00a0there have been claimed to be as one of the reasons for the overhang.Q: So that is your plan in terms of IPO transactions. What about privatisation or \u2018strategic sales\u2019? Before the pandemic, you had planned to privatise Bharat Petroleum, Air India, Concor, and Shipping Corp.A: I think regarding Air India we were proceeding at\u00a0a very good pace\u00a0before the pandemic.\u00a0We had issued a new\u00a0Expression of Interest, we had worked out certain debt levels, we have a very important condition of net current liabilities to be zero. I think there is very limited bandwidth the government has on continuously supporting Air India, which even in the best of the times pre-COVID was actually making big losses. We have to see whether it is affordable\u00a0to put the taxpayers' money continuously.\u00a0Almost about Rs 500 crore per month will be required for Air India to sustain its losses. If there are certain constraints that potential bidders are facing, I think we should remove those constraints and move the transaction\u00a0ahead. The post-COVID aviation market is also a consideration. We have to work in this new reality.Bharat Petroleum (BPCL) is promising and will continue to be the main focus of our attention. Both in terms of economy as well as in terms of the receipts to the government, this is likely to be a good transaction and this is back on track. There has been some delay because of the pandemic. The investors sought more time, hence we extended the EOI a few times.\u00a0I hope there will be no further extensions.For Concor, the EOI is ready\u00a0and\u00a0we are waiting\u00a0for the railways to finalise their land lease policy, which they will do soon. For Shipping Corp, the EOI\u00a0is\u00a0at\u00a0an advanced\u00a0stage and I think we should be coming out\u00a0with that\u00a0in November.There are some\u00a0more strategic sale transactions that we are planning. One is Nilanchal Ispat Nigam Ltd. It is a joint venture of six companies. Four of them are central PSUs and two are Odisha government PSUs. This particular plant has a huge potential in terms of the land, mines and\u00a0capacity. It could potentially reach\u00a06-7 million tons of capacity, right now it is less than one million tons.\u00a0We have done some road\u00a0shows and there is a tremendous amount of interest in\u00a0this asset. The EOI\u00a0will be out soon\u00a0and we hope to conclude it before March 31.The plans for Central Electronics Ltd have also moved to an advanced stage. We also hope to conclude the sale of two steel plants of SAIL Ltd, before March. These are Salem Steel Plant and VISP Bhadravathi. We will come out with a revised EOI of Pawan Hans, and we will look at some of the subsidiaries of Air India as well, particularly the ground-handling unit.There is also Bharat Earth Movers Ltd, the EOI is just about ready. We will hive off some non-core land assets before the deal. The plan is to retain a 28 percent stake, but sell a 26 percent stake and transfer the management control.Q: Out of the total divestment target of Rs 2.1 trillion this year, Rs 90,000 crore was expected to come from the IPO of LIC Ltd and the shedding of the Centre\u2019s stake in IDBI Bank. What is the progress on those?A: The LIC IPO\u00a0has got some parts. We have hired\u00a0Deloitte and SBI Caps as pre-IPO advisors. They are working out all the details that LIC needs to do and prepare itself, as a corporation\u00a0for the public listing. There will be certain legislative amendments that the Department of Financial Services\u00a0is working on. We have also to do an Indian embedded value and this is an essential requirement for any IPO particularly for an insurance company.\u00a0We will be issuing a\u00a0request for proposal\u00a0soon to hire\u00a0an actuarial firm to independently arrive at this embedded value.\u00a0But in order to do\u00a0that itself, LIC will have to do certain software changes and they are addressing that issue. So, I would say that there is a lot of preparation involved. But the good thing is that\u00a0we have chalked out the deadlines and timelines for\u00a0these\u00a0processes.\u00a0We are\u00a0approaching\u00a0this particular thing as a project.IDBI is very much on track.\u00a0First, we have to obtain an in-principle decision of the cabinet, for which we are getting ready.\u00a0We are at a very advanced stage and once this decision is out we can move forward.\u00a0Again it will involve\u00a0a lot of structuring of the transaction.Q: How close can you get to the Rs 2.1 lakh crore target?A: I have not made the guesstimates here. We have actually started working literally only from August. We are using all the opportunities, but are not making any sweeping judgments on anything. Wherever the opportunities exist, we will look at\u00a0it\u00a0stock by stock, transaction by transaction and then we try and complete all those transactions.\u00a0Strategic disinvestment transactions are very time consuming, because they have to pass through a long due diligence process. Therefore, to give some timeline of that kind, because everything has to be done properly,\u00a0to give you a certain figure and trying to arrive at a figure at this stage, I don't think it is possible for me. The big transactions,\u00a0if they\u00a0fructify, then obviously the achievement will be higher. All that\u00a0we can say at this stage\u00a0is that whatever disinvestments come on track, we will conclude in a proper manner.\n       ",
    "Indian state refiners' petrol and diesel sales declined in the first half of July from the same period last month, according to preliminary data, as a renewed lockdown in parts of the country and rising retail prices hit demand.India on Friday became the third country in the world to record more than one million cases of the new coronavirus, behind only the United States and Brazil, as infections spread further into the countryside and smaller towns.Fuel demand growth in India, the world's third-biggest oil importer and consumer, plunged to historic lows in April when the federal government imposed a country-wide lockdown.State-refiners' diesel sales, which account for two-fifth of overall refined fuel sales in India, fell by 18\u00a0percent to 2.2 million tonnes (MT) in the first half of July from the same period in June, and by about 21 percent from a year earlier, according to data compiled by Indian Oil Corp.State companies - Indian Oil Corp, Hindustan Petroleum Corp and Bharat Petroleum - own about 90 percent of India's retail fuel outlets.COVID-19 VaccineFrequently Asked QuestionsA vaccine works by mimicking a natural infection. A vaccine not only induces immune response to protect people from any future COVID-19 infection, but also helps quickly build herd immunity to put an end to the pandemic. Herd immunity occurs when a sufficient percentage of a population becomes immune to a disease, making the spread of disease from person to person unlikely. The good news is that SARS-CoV-2 virus has been fairly stable, which increases the viability of a vaccine.There are broadly four types of vaccine \u2014 one, a vaccine based on the whole virus (this could be either inactivated, or an attenuated [weakened] virus vaccine); two, a non-replicating viral vector vaccine that uses a benign virus as vector that carries the antigen of SARS-CoV; three, nucleic-acid vaccines that have genetic material like DNA and RNA of antigens like spike protein given to a person, helping  human cells decode genetic material and produce the vaccine; and four, protein subunit vaccine wherein the recombinant proteins of SARS-COV-2 along with an adjuvant (booster) is given as a vaccine.Vaccine development is a long, complex process. Unlike drugs that are given to people with a diseased, vaccines are given to healthy people and also vulnerable sections such as children, pregnant women and the elderly. So rigorous tests are compulsory. History says that the fastest time it took to develop a vaccine is five years, but it usually takes double or sometimes triple that time.Indian fuel demand had gathered pace from May when the lockdown was partly eased. But a spike in cases of coronavirus infection has led to authorities imposing fresh lockdowns and designating new containment zones in several states this week, including the largely rural Bihar in the east and the southern tech hub Bengaluru.State companies' sales of petrol fell 6.7 percent to 880,000 tonnes in the first half of July from the same period in June, and by about 12 percent from a year earlier, the data showed.\"Retail sales are down because of reimposed lockdown and higher retail prices,\" said Sri Paravaikkarasu, director for Asia oil at consultancy FGE.India's diesel price has touched a record high of 81.35 rupees ($1.09) a liter on Friday in New Delhi, slightly higher than that of petrol.India's overall refined fuel demand includes consumption of fuel oil, bitumen and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).State retailers sold 6.5\u00a0percent more LPG in the first half of July from a year ago, at about 1.075MT.Follow our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic here.

    "India plans to completely fill its strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) by the third week of May by moving about 19 million barrels into the sites by then, the managing director of the country's SPR said on Tuesday.India is moving the oil to the SPR to help the country's refineries reduce their excess crude as the lockdown to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus has dented transportation and industrial fuel consumption in Asia's third-largest economy.India's fuel demand in March declined by 17.8 percent, the lowest in over two decades.India will be diverting cargoes for loading in April already bought by refiners Indian Oil Corp, Bharat Petroleum, Hindustan Petroleum and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd. The refiners cut their crude processing after local fuel demand collapsed and are unable to store the excess oil themselves.\"As of now the plan is to fill the caverns by (the third week of May), before the arrival monsoon rains. We are buying oil from state refiners,\" H.P.S. Ahuja, the managing director of the Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Ltd (ISPRL) said. ISPRL is responsible for building and filling of SPR sites.ISPRL wants to receive the cargoes before India's monsoon begins in May as the single point mooring system that can unload very large crude carriers (VLCC) at the port of Mangalore, which will feed two SPR sites, is shut during the three-month rainy season.Reuters last month reported India planned to buy oil from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia to fill its SPR to gain from low prices.\"We are taking advantage of low oil prices,\" he said, adding most of these cargoes are linked to official selling prices (OSP) for April.Saudi Arabia drastically cut its OSPs for April to boost its oil sales after major producers failed to agree to extend a supply curtailment agreement that expired at the end of March.Ahuja said ISPRL hopes to receive the last oil cargo on May 21, while IOC supplied a VLCC containing oil from the UAE on Monday.The SPR is divided between three locations in southern India and can store about 37 million barrels of oil, equivalent to about 9.5 days of India's oil demand. A portion of the SPR is already filled.The federal government has allocated about 38 billion rupees ($498.18 million) for the oil purchases, he said.Follow our full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic here.

    "Shares of\u00a0Bharat Petroleum (BPCL) plummeted\u00a0more than 5 percent, while shares of\u00a0Hindustan Petroleum (HPCL) fell more than 3 percent intraday on May 21 despite the oil refining majors reporting strong Q4 numbers.BPCL\u00a0in its BSE release said net profit for the quarter ended March 2019 grew 16.21 percent at\u00a0Rs 3,124.91, compared to\u00a0Rs 2,688.97 crore in the corresponding quarter last year.Revenue soared\u00a010.33 percent to Rs 83,941.67 crore from Rs 76,080.39 crore on a yearly basis.Meanwhile, HPCL\u00a0reported a 70 percent jump in its fourth-quarter net profit as inventory gains and rupee appreciation negated a dip in refinery margins.Net profit in January-March came at Rs 2,970 crore against Rs 1,748 crore in the same period a year back, said HPCL Chairman and Managing Director MK Surana.Brokerage firm CLSA\u00a0has a sell rating on both companies, with a target at Rs 300 for BPCL and Rs 210 for HPCL.According to CLSA, BPCL's core performance has been weak\u00a0accompanied by lower-than-expected inventory gains. The brokerage said HPCL's refining was in line, but the company missed on marketing.Deutsche Bank, on the other hand,\u00a0has a buy rating on both\u00a0oil refining majors,\u00a0with target at Rs 465 for BPCL and Rs 335 for HPCL.The brokerage has a buy rating for BPCL on an estimated 28 percent increase in refining segment EBITDA over FY19-21, while it said that marketing has offset weak refining performance for HPCL.At 1149 hours, BPCL was quoting at Rs\u00a0372.05, down 5.22 percent. HPCL was quoting at Rs\u00a0284.75, down 3.01 percent on the BSE.\n       ",
    "Ruchi AgrawalMoneycontrol ResearchAfter weak results from Indian oil corporation (IOCL) and Hindustan petroleum corporation (HPCL),\u00a0Bharat petroleum corporation (BPCL)\u00a0also reported a weak performance in Q3. Despite an uptick in revenue, the operating and net margins declined sharply both year-on-year and sequentially. Gross refining margins (GRMs) dipped in line with global margin contraction. Substantial inventory losses ate away the quarter\u2019s profitability.-GRMs for the nine months from April to December were at $5.25 per barrel (9MFY18: $6.97). GRM for the quarter was $2.78 per barrel (Q3FY18: 7.89), a sharp dip YoY. While there has been a weakness in GRMs globally with the Singapore benchmark at $4.5 per barrel (Q2: $6.1), BPCL\u2019s GRMs saw a much greater impact-Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) declined 77 percent YoY (-69 percent sequentially) due to high inventory losses, and input costs, employee expenses and finance costs.-A sharp uptick in crude prices since October 2018 led to high inventory losses during the quarter which was single main reason for the contraction in profits and margins. This also indicates a not-so-weak core performance.-Other expenses includes a foreign exchange gain during the quarter of Rs 659 crore (Q3FY18: Rs 172 crore gain) which led to a noticeable decline in the expenses.-Volumes in the export business grew 55 percent sequentially (YoY: +36.2 percent)-Domestic volumes were largely flat YoY, while there was 6 percent sequential improvement-The overall performance of the company appears weak much in line with expectations and other oil marketing companies. With volatile crude prices, upcoming central elections and tweaking of marketing margins around elections, we remain cautious on the company\u2019s performance.Follow @RuchiagrawalFor more research articles, visit our\u00a0Moneycontrol Research Page.

    "Global rating agency Moody's affirmed the Baa2 ratings on Bharat Petroleum Corporation and its subsidiary BPRL International Singapore (BPRL) on improving operating profile despite weak credit metrics, with a stable outlook.The Singapore-based agency also expects a high likelihood of extraordinary support from the government in times of need and a very high level of dependence between the government and BPCL, a situation which results in a two-notch rating uplift.\"We expect BPCL's credit metrics will weaken and stay at the weaker end of the tolerance level of its Ba1 baseline credit assessment,\" Vikas Halan, a senior vice-president at the agency, said in a statement.He further said, the ratings also remains constrained by the uncertainty around the government policy for the oil & gas sector, especially in terms of pricing and sector consolidation.Moody's expects the company to moderate its dividend payments or adjust its capital spending over the next 12-18 months such that its credit metrics will improve to levels more appropriate for its Ba1 baseline credit assessment.In the absence of such improvement, its baseline credit assessment may come under pressure, it said.The agency also noted that the operating profile has improved since the completion of its Kochi refinery in 2018 and its total refining throughput increased to 37.7 million tonne in FY18 from 34.4 million tonne in FY17.The company has also upgraded its refinery to use a higher proportion of heavy crude oil, positioning it well to benefit from the increasing differential between light and heavy crude oil, it said.\"Given its high dividend payouts and weak cash flow, Ba1 assessment is unlikely to be upgraded to Baa3 over the next 12-18 months. Also, upward pressure may emerge over time if there is clarity around the government policy for the oil & gas sector, and around BPCL's own financial policy for shareholder returns,\" it added.\n       ",
    "Saudi Aramco, the world's largest oil company, is seeking a majority stake in the proposed Rs 3 lakh crore oil refinery at Ratnagiri in Maharashtra, according to a report by The Economic Times.The report adds that one of the oil company's conditions include that most of the oil is sourced from Saudi Arabia.The Dhahran-based company has been in talks with\u00a0Indian Oil Corporation,\u00a0Bharat Petroleum, and\u00a0 Hindustan Petroleum\u00a0for months, the report said.\"They have just drawn the starting line. Only after the negotiations have concluded, you would know what Aramco has finally got,\" a source told the paper.The petrochemical project is a joint venture between the three Indian state-owned refiners. The Rs 3-lakh project\u00a0 has a refining capacity of 60 million metric tonnes per annum.In response to\u00a0a\u00a0request for comment by The Economic Times,\u00a0Aramco confirmed the discussions.\"Saudi Aramco views India as an important strategic market and is a reliable and leading supplier of crude oil to India. We are looking at various opportunities in India which includes refining. We are in discussions with Indian counterparties in these potential ventures and hope to progress our cooperation and partnership further.\", the company told the paper.The company did not provide details of the negotiation.One source, speaking to\u00a0The Economic Times, ruled out the possibility of giving Aramco a majority stake in the refinery.\"Giving Aramco the majority stake is just out of the question. If we can\u2019t have the majority stake in our own project, on our own land, then where,\" the source said.Maharastra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis last month assured that the project will be launched after negotiations with the stakeholders.Local fishermen and farmers are against the project because it hurts their livelihood, Business Standard reports.\n       ",
    "State-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) may buy 26 percent stake each in gas utility GAIL India Ltd, paying the government over Rs 20,000 crore each to become integrated energy firms.Following Finance Minister Arun Jaitley's February 2017 Budget announcement of creating integrated oil majors, IOC and BPCL had submitted separate proposals to buy the government's 54.89 percent stake in India's biggest gas marketing and transportation firm, GAIL.A top source said since the government is not looking at actual merger of oil companies but only transfer of its ownership to a cash rich PSU, the best option would be to split the 54.89 percent holding in GAIL equally between IOC and BPCL.At Friday's closing price of Rs 440.85 a share for GAIL on BSE, the stake is worth close to Rs 41,000 crore.In January this year, Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC) bought out government's 51.11 per cent stake in refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) for Rs 36,915 crore. But HPCL hasn't been merged with ONGC and continues to remain a separate listed company with the same board. After the buyout, HPCL has become a subsidiary of ONGC, which gets up to two seats on the company board.The source said IOC and BPCL too can follow the same model and split the government's stake equally among themselves. GAIL will become their subsidiary and will continue to operate as a listed company with an independent board. IOC and BPCL would get to appoint one director each on GAIL board.Like in case of ONGC's acquisition of HPCL, the government would get to encash its holding in GAIL yet retain control over the company through IOC and BPCL.The source said the government has so far not taken any view on the proposals made by IOC and BPCL. How and to whom the stake would be sold will be decided after inter-ministerial consultations, he said adding that the option of splitting the stake equally among the two firms is one of the options that would be considered during such deliberations.Jaitley in the 2017-18 Budget had unveiled government's plan to create integrated public sector oil majors \"through consolidation, mergers and acquisitions\" so as that the merged company has \"capacity to bear higher risks, avail economies of scale, take higher investment decisions\" and is \"able to match the performance of international and domestic private companies?.Following this, ONGC expressed interest in taking over HPCL while IOC and BPCL said they keen on taking over GAIL to help add natural gas transportation and marketing business to their kitty.The government took up ONGC's proposal first and the transaction was completed at January-end this year.IOC, the largest oil refiner and fuel marketing company in the country, wanted to either acquire another refiner to add to its capacity or a gas company like GAIL.The firm feels it already has a fledging gas business in under-construction liquefied natural gas terminals, city gas distribution projects and gas marketing. And GAIL, the nation's biggest gas transporter and marketing company, would complement that.BPCL, on the other hand, too has natural gas ambitions and wrote to the oil ministry saying GAIL was its number one choice for acquisition. It listed Oil India Ltd, the nation's second largest exploration firm, as its number two choice.The government holds 66.13 per cent stake in OIL, which at current market price is worth about Rs 18,000 crore.Incorporated in August 1984 by spinning off gas business of ONGC, GAIL (India) Ltd owns and operates about 11,000-km of natural gas pipelines in the country. It sells around 60 per cent of natural gas in the country.\n       ",

    "Bharat Petroleum, which has just been upgraded to a Maharatna company, today said it has lined up capital expenditure of Rs 1.08 trillion for the next five years.The public sector oil retailer will spend the money on capacity expansion of refineries as well as marketing and upstream activities, its chairman and managing director D Rajkumar told reporters at a post-AGM press meet here late evening.The chairman said the company will focus primarily on going global to further expand the business, especially in upstream activities.On the performance of the company in the year gone-by, he said both marketing and refinery businesses did well, with the refinery capacity utilisation touching 112 per cent.On the upstream front also it has done relatively well, he added.Explainer: How Daily Revision Of Petrol, Diesel Prices WorksFrom the upstream business, the first dividend from the Russian assets have already come, which is roughly USD 27 million in the first quarter, Rajkumar said.On the benefits of Maharatna status, Rajkumar said it will help the company raise cheaper funds, apart from giving it financial freedom.\"For instance this will empower our board to sanction investments of up to Rs 5,000 crore in a single project, which is five-times more than when we were a Mini-ratna company,\" he said.\n       "
