    "The market participants are expected to remain cautious on the Nifty 50 given the rising volatility index from 10 to 17 levels in just nine trading sessions. Hence, unless and until, the volatility cools down, the rangebound trade with negative bias is likely to continue with support at 22,150, which coincides with the lower end of rising channel, but if the volatility stabilises or falls from current levels, then possibility of short-covering-led uptrend can take the Nifty towards 22,500-22,600 levels, experts said.On May 7, the Nifty 50 dropped 140 points to 22,303 and formed long bearish candlestick pattern on the daily charts, while the BSE Sensex was down 384 points at 73,512.The broader markets hit quite hard on Tuesday as the Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 indices fell nearly 2 percent each on weak breadth.Stocks that bucked the trend and supported by bulls included Hindustan Unilever, Dabur India, and TCS. Hindustan Unilever was the biggest gainer in the Nifty 50, rising 5.5 percent to Rs 2,379 and formed robust bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts. The stock, in fact, went closer to its 200-day EMA (exponential moving average) after climbing above 50 and 100-day EMAs in a single session, with multi-fold jump in volumes over previous day.Dabur India also acted in a similar fashion, up 5.2 percent at Rs 558.5 and formed strong bullish candlestick pattern on the daily timeframe with significantly higher volumes. Now, the stock traded well above all key moving averages, which is a positive sign.TCS maintained higher highs, higher lows formation and rallied for second consecutive session on Tuesday. The stock rose 1.5 percent to Rs 3,979, and formed bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts, while it traded above all key moving averages now.Here's what Riyank Arora of Mehta Equities recommends investors should do with these stocks when the market resumes trading today:Hindustan UnileverThe stock has given a strong breakout above its 21-day EMA (exponential moving average) and 50-day SMA (simple moving average) managing to give a bullish closing above its recent swing high resistance mark of Rs 2,306.75 as well.With the RSI (relative strength index 14) being around 70 and seeing a good uptick, the overall momentum looks strong and the stock should likely head higher towards Rs 2,600 and above. We suggest investors to hold their positions with a trailing stop-loss of Rs 2,250 on Hindustan Unilever.Tata Consultancy Services (TCS)The stock has touched an important resistance mark of Rs 3,980.00 on the daily charts. With the price hovering around its 21-day EMA and 50-day SMA, this level should serve as a crucial resistance mark for the stock.Any move above Rs 4,000 should push the rally towards Rs 4,100 and Rs 4,150 on TCS.

With the RSI (14) being around 60 and witnessing a good up-tick, it appears that the stock should likely pick up momentum in the upcoming few trading sessions.Any breakout above Rs 567.50 should be considered as a strong bullish sign for the stock and we can expect the rally to push further towards Rs 600 as FMCG stocks continue to outperform.

    "The leading performers on the frontline Nifty 50 index on May 7 were the FMCG giants: Hindustan Unilever, Britannia Industries, Nestle India, ITC, and Tata Consumer.\u00a0These companies saw impressive gains of up to 5 percent on Tuesday.As the\u00a0March quarter earning results trickle in, experts have noted that the commentary surrounding the FMCG sector has mostly been positive. Despite largely unchanged demand trends from the previous quarter, volumes have seen a minor uptick, with rural recovery on the horizon.At 11:15 am, the top gainer on the Nifty 50 was\u00a0Hindustan Unilever, and its shares were quoting Rs 2,360.9 apiece, higher by 4.6 percent.In comparison, the Nifty 50\u00a0tumbled 0.75 percent to\u00a022,270 levels.

    "Hindustan Unilever Ltd Chief Financial Officer Ritesh Tiwari struck an optimistic chord on rural consumption, projecting high single-digit volume growth rates. Tiwari cited expectations of a favourable monsoon coupled with an improving macroeconomic environment as factors that would spur rural demand to outpace the industry average.In an interview, Tiwari said the company\u2019s near-term focus is on driving volume growth, enhancing gross margins, and maintaining Ebitda margins. Tiwari spoke about how the company is leveraging its premium products to drive growth, while also looking to deepen its market share in large product categories.He also touched upon HUL\u2019s capital allocation strategy and its focus on prioritising high dividend payout for its shareholders. Edited excerpts:Q: Can you provide an overview of the latest Q4 results and the strategy moving forward?A: Our strategy moving forward revolves around prioritising volume growth amid the current landscape. Given the current state of commodities, we anticipate minimal price growth in the coming quarters. Our approach, therefore, involves three key priorities: first, driving volume growth; second, enhancing gross margins to fuel further investment; and third, ensuring competitiveness in the market by expanding market share.Q: Can you outline your capital allocation strategy, considering your surplus and dividend commitments?A: Absolutely. Our capital allocation strategy encompasses three key areas. Firstly, we prioritise funding growth within our business. This means investing in initiatives that enhance our capabilities such as market research and digital advancements. For instance, we've recently allocated funds from a 350 basis points gross margin improvement towards business investments.Secondly, we believe in rewarding our shareholders through high dividends, reflecting our low capital intensity. We consistently maintain a dividend payout ratio of over 90 percent, with recent growth of 8 percent year-on-year in dividends.Thirdly, we actively explore bolt-on acquisition opportunities to expand our portfolio where there are gaps. Whether through brand extensions, bringing in brands from Unilever's portfolio, launching our own brands, or pursuing acquisitions like our majority stake in OZiva and minority stake in Wellbeing Nutrition. This approach ensures we're continually building our portfolio for the future.Q: The stock performance seems to have plateaued despite promising business prospects. What do you attribute this stagnation to?A: When assessing stock performance, it's essential to consider several fundamental principles that guide investor sentiment. Firstly, consistent growth is paramount. Investors value companies that demonstrate sustained growth over time. Secondly, competitiveness plays a significant role. Growing ahead of the market indicates strength and resilience. As for margins, while our current focus is on top line growth, we aim to maintain it at the current range of 23 to 24 percent in the near term whilst making modest improvements in mid-long term.In terms of our recent performance, we've consistently added substantial turnover to our top line, showcasing the scale benefits of our wide-ranging portfolio spanning multiple FMCG categories. Despite challenges in certain quarters, such as the impact of external market dynamics, we've remained steadfast in our commitment to growth and profitability.Furthermore, our continuous focus on capital discipline and competitiveness in the market has been appreciated. Our diverse portfolio, coupled with our talented workforce and thought leadership, positions us strongly for the future. We've always been at the forefront of innovation, whether it's introducing new product formats or pioneering business models like our B2B initiatives with retailers.Q: Has the idea of a share buyback crossed your mind as part of the capital allocation strategy?A: The board continually assesses various options, including share buybacks. With a strong cash position, we maintain a robust financial standing. Our capital allocation approach prioritises high dividend payouts, ensuring returns to our shareholders. Additionally, we remain open to strategic acquisitions that align with our business objectives. When evaluating the potential for share buybacks, we consider factors such as market conditions, shareholder value, and available cash reserves. Ultimately, our decisions are guided by maximising long-term value for our shareholders while maintaining financial prudence and flexibility.Q: When you talk about volume growth, do you see overall demand growth complementing that or will it be through winning more market share?A: It will include both. When analysing our latest quarter results, we see distinct trends across our portfolio. Approximately half of our portfolio is experiencing growth in mid to high single-digit volumes, which is promising. However, a quarter of our portfolio is holding steady in terms of volumes, while another quarter is seeing a decline.Our coffee segment has been affected by significant inflation in commodity prices, resulting in decreased volumes. Similarly, our skin cleansing segment has faced challenges due to pricing competitiveness, though we're addressing these issues. Additionally, our tea segment has been grappling with the market downgrading to loose tea due to widening price gaps between premium and lower-tier teas.Moving forward, our strategy is focused on agility and responsiveness to consumer behaviour and market dynamics. Rather than wait for macroeconomic shifts, we're aligning our investments with areas of growth and consumer demand. For instance, our premium beauty business is experiencing double-digit growth, while high-priority segments such as face cleansers, serums, and skincare are showing promising growth trajectories. We're also leveraging the e-commerce channel, which is witnessing robust growth rates, particularly in urban areas.Our approach entails doubling down on investments in these growth areas while remaining attentive to broader economic indicators such as GDP growth and monsoon forecasts. We anticipate that with continued investment and market recovery, particularly in the second half of the financial year, we'll see improvements in overall market conditions.Q: How do you plan to drive volume growth in the near to medium term?A: Firstly, we're committed to market development initiatives to expand the reach and consumption of existing large categories. For instance, in highly penetrated categories like soap bars and laundry, there's significant untapped potential to drive further growth by venturing into incremental premium consumer segments and other need spaces. By focusing on market development, we aim to create more users and drive consumption, particularly in premium segments.Secondly, we're prioritising the expansion of our premium portfolio. Currently, approximately one-third of our business sits in the premium segment, which is experiencing above-average growth. We're doubling down on this segment by investing in innovation and marketing to further drive growth.Additionally, we're continuously seeding growth in emerging formats and demand spaces. In the beauty sector, we're witnessing disproportionate growth in segments like skincare and haircare. Despite competition from challenger brands, we remain confident in our market-leading positions and focus on expanding our portfolio to capture market value. By extending our existing brands into new spaces and launching new brands where needed, we're poised to capitalise on the under-penetrated market and drive growth.Q: What growth rates do you anticipate for rural markets in the near future, and how do you expect this growth to unfold?A: When considering rural growth rates, it's important to contextualise the numbers. Currently, we're observing headline growth rates in the double digits, around 12 percent. However, this growth is measured against a base of a declining market from the same period last year. Looking at a two-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR), we're beginning to see rural growth rates trending moderately positive, indicating a recovery from the previous decline.I anticipate that rural markets will continue to strengthen, with high single-digit growth rates in volumes becoming more prevalent. This recovery is significant as it signifies a transition from a declining base to a growing one. With factors like improved monsoon patterns and favourable macroeconomic conditions, I foresee rural growth rates outpacing average FMCG growth rates in the coming years. As rural areas have historically been critical drivers of demand, this upward trajectory is promising for the overall FMCG sector.Q: Looking ahead to the next three to four years, do you see growth primarily originating from your premium portfolio?A: Firstly, we expect continued growth through market development initiatives in existing large categories. Categories like soap bars and liquid soaps have the potential to drive further growth. Similarly, products like Horlicks cater to the prevalent dietary patterns in India, offering functional nutrition solutions to address micronutrient deficiencies. By focusing on improving market penetration and consumption in such categories, we anticipate sustained growth.Secondly, we see opportunities for growth in premium segments. As consumer spending trends evolve, particularly among urban consumers, there's a growing demand for premium products across various categories. By expanding our portfolio into premium spaces and catering to the evolving needs of consumers, we aim to capture this segment's growth potential. This includes areas like skincare, where multi-step routines are becoming increasingly popular among certain consumer segments.Additionally, macroeconomic factors such as improvements in Indian GDP and overall consumption patterns are expected to contribute to growth. As the macroeconomic landscape strengthens, it creates a conducive environment for FMCG growth, providing further opportunities for expansion.Q: How do you envision the evolution of your distribution channels?A: The landscape of distribution channels in India is dynamic, with each channel playing a crucial role in reaching consumers effectively. Currently, general trade (GT) stands as the dominant channel, comprising around 60-70 percent of our business. We anticipate GT to maintain its prominence for the foreseeable future, with its significance likely to endure for the next few decades. Therefore, investing in GT and ensuring its future readiness is a key priority for us.Additionally, we observe a growing share of sales coming from modern trade (MT) and e-commerce channels. Modern trade, represented by large-format, organised retail, contributes approximately 20 percent, while e-commerce accounts for 7 percent of our sales. While these channels are growing, we don't foresee GT diminishing rapidly. Instead, we expect it to be a gradual shift.E-commerce, in particular, is witnessing significant segmentation and development. From traditional players like Amazon and Flipkart to emerging models such as quick commerce, the channel is diversifying rapidly. Quick commerce offers unparalleled convenience, allowing consumers to receive products within minutes.Our approach to e-commerce encompasses both B2B and B2C models. B2B transactions involve supplying products to kirana stores through digital platforms, while B2C transactions cater directly to end-consumers. We've observed substantial growth in e-commerce sales in recent years, with the channel's share increasing from less than 5 percent to 7 percent.While we anticipate further growth in e-commerce, we remain committed to nurturing our distribution network, especially GT. Distributors play a pivotal role in ensuring last-mile connectivity and will continue to be a cornerstone of our distribution strategy. As such, we're dedicated to investing in our distributor network to strengthen our presence across channels and adapt to evolving consumer preferences effectively.Q: On the margins front, you spoke of maintaining the current EBITDA margins despite factors like the discontinuation of the GSK distribution business. How confident are you in sustaining these margin levels?A: The decision to discontinue the GSK distribution business does have a 50-60 basis points impact on our margins. However, our strategy revolves around several initiatives to offset this impact and ensure margin stability.Our primary approach is to enhance gross margins through improvements in our supply chain, raw material sourcing, and pricing strategies. Over the past year, we've seen a significant improvement in gross margins, reflecting our commitment to this strategy. Additionally, we operate with a healthy level of net profit margin, allowing us sufficient room for investment in various areas of the business.One of our key programmes, Symphony, focuses on generating annual savings of 7-8 percent across all lines of our profit and loss statement. These savings are then reinvested into the business to drive innovation, enhance capabilities, and improve market positioning.Q: Despite India's inflation being relatively moderate compared to other countries, your recent commentary suggests that consumers have felt its impact. Can you elaborate on this?A: Absolutely. While India's inflation may not seem alarmingly high on a global scale, the cumulative effect over the last few years has significantly impacted consumers, particularly in the FMCG sector. Over the past three years, the cumulative inflation in the FMCG market equals that of the previous five years. This inflationary pressure has compelled the FMCG industry, including us, to adjust prices to account for rising costs of commodities like crude oil and palm oil, among others.As a result, consumers have experienced a decrease in their disposable income, which has affected overall demand. While we're beginning to see signs of deflation, prices are still higher compared to previous years. This adjustment period has influenced our market growth, which, while promising in high single digits, is still below expectations, given India's low per capita consumption.As GDP improves and consumer confidence strengthens, we anticipate a more robust market environment. With efforts to drive premiumisation and address issues of low consumption and penetration, we remain optimistic about the potential for accelerated growth in the FMCG sector, surpassing current high single-digit levels.\n       ",
    "Prabhudas Lilladher's research report on Hindustan UnileverWe cut FY25/26EPS by 1.6/1.3% factoring in 1) slower than expected recovery in volumes in rural India 2) price cuts in personal wash and skin care to improve consumer price value equation 3) sustained competitive intensity across mass segment in HPC segment resulting in market share loss and 4) higher investments in A&P and innovations to sustain LT growth. While HC, F&R and & Beauty segment are doing well across channels, price correction in soaps and skin should provide growth push from 2H25, in our view. We believe normal monsoon can provide flip to rural demand although margin expansion from current levels will be very moderate (50bps over FY24-26).OutlookLong-term growth levers led by higher growth in Ecom and categories of future (liquids, Green Tea, premium skincare etc.) and premium segments remains intact, we estimate 8% PAT CAGR over FY24-26 and assign DCF based target price of Rs2543 (Rs2600 earlier). Risk reward looks favourable post little returns in last 4 years; however, significant re-rating looks unlikely given valuations at 44.6xFY26 and market momentum in favour of cyclicals. We upgrade the stock to Accumulate (Hold earlier) for moderate returns over next 12-15 months.For all recommendations report,\u00a0click hereDisclaimer:\u00a0The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

    "Hindustan Unilever\u2019s fourth-quarter financial\u00a0results fell short of expectations, even addition of premium products pushed revenue growth during the quarter. Margins shrank and net profit fell more than expected, as volume growth slowed down on lower demand and rising competition.Brokerages slashed the target prices on the\u00a0Hindustan Unilever stock as the outlook for the FMCG giant remained uncertain and growth prospects remained lacklustre.The Surf Excel-maker reported 6 percent on-year fall in standalone net profit at Rs 2,406 crore in the fiscal fourth quarter. Hindustan Unilever's sales rose only marginally to Rs 14,693 crore in the fourth quarter.Analysts projected a profit of Rs 2,435 crore on a revenue of Rs 14,913 crore, according to the average of nine brokerage estimates.Volume growth disappointsThe consumer goods company\u2019s sales volume grew only 2 percent, short of the Street forecast of 3 percent. The growth was led by mid-single-digit growth in homecare, while beauty and personal care (BPC) and foods and refreshments (F&R) clocked flat volume.Also Read |\u00a0HUL\u2019s personal care business sees 10% drop in sales in Q4The overall beauty and personal care business contributed 35 percent of the FMCG major\u2019s overall revenue for the March quarter with sales of Rs 5,050 crore. While the personal care segment saw a decline in sales, the beauty segment saw a 4 percent growth, the company said.HUL has gained penetration in around 75 percent of its portfolio, with three quarters of the firm\u2019s offerings gaining or maintaining the market share.The current thrust on premiumisation, which has a 25 percent contribution to the business, is largely focused on the laundry and shampoo segments. The premium portfolio saw growth across all categories, but its mass portfolio was weak.Motilal Oswal said it expects a gradual recovery in volume growth in FY25. The growth will be driven by own initiatives and gradual improvement in demand.\u201cThe impact of price cuts will persist in 1HFY25, but the volume print should improve during this phase and the full revenue recovery will be visible in 2HFY25,\u201d said the brokerage.The firm\u2019s management said that it was hopeful of a gradual recovery in the rural markets, which is dependent on the improvement in monsoon scenario. Additionally, measures such as price cuts should lead to better growth in the mass segments.Food & refreshment impresses, soaps lose foamIn food and refreshments (F&R), the functional nutrition drinks saw high single-digit growth, as a result of increased penetration and market share gains. Soup and food solutions buoyed the foods growth, while ice cream reported double-digit volume-led growth. Coffee grew in double-digits led by pricing.International brokerage Goldman Sachs said the deterioration in the soaps business is concerning, as its weak performance continued. The recovery in the soap segment could take a few quarters. The fall in the soap business led to the miss in the beauty and personal care segment.EBITDA margin impactedHindustan Unilever\u2019s spending on advertisements and promotions (A&P) saw a 23 percent on-year rise. In terms of spending as a portion of revenue, it was 10.8 percent, which is higher by 200 basis points (bps) on-year.Also Read |\u00a0Hindustan Unilever eyes modest margin improvement on better product mixThe EBITDA margin contracted around 20 basis points on-year to 23.1 percent, since there was an impact of 60 bps from the termination of the GSK consignment sales.Hindustan Unilever and GSK Consumer decided to terminate their distribution agreement in 2022. From November 2023, HUL stopped selling GSK Consumer products such as Sensodyne, Crocin, Otrivin and Eno brands in India.The raw material pricing in key categories remained benign, and JM Financial noted that the company will realign its focus to improve the mix and reduce production costs to further grow the gross margin.Should you buy, sell or hold HUL stock?HSBC raised alarms regarding HUL\u2019s outlook, as the rise in unorganised, regional competition and poor rural demand showed poor growth prospects. The international brokerage maintained its \u2018hold\u2019 call, with a target price of Rs 2,300 per share.\u201cWith negatives largely known, the stock\u2019s very low return over the last three years and valuation below historical average could likely provide some support on the downside. Given the tough operating landscape, rerating will be contingent on better visibility on volume acceleration and double-digit earnings growth,\u201d\u00a0JM Financial said.The domestic brokerage had a share price target of Rs 2,640 on the counter, with a \u2018buy\u2019 call.Disclaimer:\u00a0The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "Hindustan Unilever has re-named its 'health food drinks' category as functional nutritional drinks (FND), a move after the Ministry of Commerce and Industry asked e-commerce websites to remove drinks and beverages from 'heathy drinks' category on their platform.\"We have changed the labels of the category to FND which is a much better way to call it,\" said Ritesh Tiwari, chief financial officer of Hindustan Unilever at the earnings press conference on April 24.Tiwari said that the FND category is under-penetrated and hence there is a big opportunity for growth in the same. Hindustan Unilever will focus on increasing customers, increasing usage, and giving more benefits for consumers to upgrade in the FND category, said Tiwari. He also said that the company is seeing better growth in its premium FND range which caters to Diabetes and women's health.During FY24, Horlicks has seen strong penetration and market share gains, said the company in its investor presentation.Also read Urban markets, premium products continue to drive FMCG growth even as rural demand seeing recovery: HULThe National Commission for Protection of Child Rights recently had said that there is no definition for 'health drinks' under the Food Safety and Standards Act 2006. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), earlier this month, had asked e-commerce websites not to put dairy, cereal, or malt-based beverages under the \u2018health drink\u2019 or \u2018energy drink\u2019 categories.The reason - health drink is not defined in the food laws of India, while 'energy drinks' are just flavoured water-based drinks under the laws, argued FSSAI. FSSAI said using wrong terms can mislead the consumers and had hence asked the websites to either remove or correct the advertisements.All these developments happened after Mondalez India-owned Bournvita caught attention for its high sugar levels a year\u00a0ago.As per Technavio, an industry market research and advisory firm, the health beverages market share in India is expected to increase by $3.84 billion from 2021 to 2026, and the market's growth momentum will accelerate at a CAGR of 9.89 percent.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) is focusing on six major segments in the beauty category to drive growth - Facial cleansers, Weatherproof Bodycare, Serums, Face Cleansing and the Massitge segment.HUL reported a 10 percent decrease in underlying sales growth for its personal care business, mainly due to a decline in its skin cleaning portfolio, including brands such as Lux.The overall beauty and personal care business experienced a\u00a0two\u00a0percent decline in underlying sales growth, with volume remaining flat. This segment contributed 35 percent of HUL's total revenue for the March quarter, amounting to Rs 5,050 crore.Despite the decline in the personal care segment, the beauty segment witnessed a four percent growth, according to HUL.The company has separated the beauty and personal care businesses and is aiming for the beauty segment to drive both profit and growth.Masstige is HUL\u2019s premium segment comprising of brands like \u2018LOVE beauty AND planet\u2019 which is above Rs 100-200 mark. The company is witnessing a fair amount of growth in ecommerce.\u201cSuncare product is already more than 250 crore business for us. It is still just the beginning,\u201d HUL's CEO\u00a0Rohit Jawa said in a press conference on April 24.The management said that while its beauty product line primarily targets urban consumers, it would be inaccurate to suggest that rural markets are neglected.\u201cIt would be wrong to say that it doesn\u2019t cater to some consumers in rural areas like suncare as we have a glow and lovely for suncare as well. The total addressable market will be small for rural,\u201d said Jawa.The company said premiumization is more pronounced in urban markets, which are typically more resilient, especially among middle-income and higher-income households.FMCG inflation has been high overall, rural consumers have had to adjust their consumption patterns, particularly for discretionary items, the company said. However, with better monsoons and improvements in the agricultural economy, it anticipates growth in rural markets. Products like Surf Excel and Ezee have been significant contributors to its growth, particularly in rural areas, the company noted.\u201cOf course there is growth but the scale of growth would be better when the macros are better for rural. But the urban is more resilient and the premium end more robust.\u201d said Jawa.Hindustan Unilever Ltd on April 24 reported six percent fall in standalone net profit at Rs 2,406 crore for the fiscal fourth quarter as against Rs 2,552 crore in the year-ago period.\n       ",
    "FMCG major Hindustan Unilever Limited (HUL), which on\u00a0April 24 reported a 6 percent fall in standalone net profit for the March quarter, said that urban markets and premium products are continuing to drive growth for FMCG players, even as rural demand has seen gradual recovery.\u201cRural markets have recovered on a quarter-on-quarter basis continuously for the last four quarters,\u201d said Ritesh Tiwari, CFO, HUL.HUL on April 24 reported\u00a0six percent fall in standalone net profit at Rs 2,406 crore for the fiscal fourth quarter as against Rs 2,552 crore in the year-ago period.The FMCG giant\u2019s sales rose only marginally to Rs 14,693 crore in the fourth quarter, with revenue in a key segment, beauty, and personal care, declining 2.7 percent.Analysts had projected a profit of Rs 2,435 crore on revenue of Rs 14,913 crore, the number being an average of nine brokerage estimates.Normal monsoonTiwari said that with the monsoon expected to be normal and an improving macro-situation, rural recovery should continue going forward.However, the rural segment has still not outpaced urban, the management noted.Hindustan Unilever\u2019s CEO Rohit Jawa added that growth for the FMCG major is being driven by urban markets, modern trade and e-commerce and its premium products portfolio.Commenting on the outlook for the FMCG sector, the HUL management said that it sees FMCG demand to continue improving gradually.However, they expect price growth to be low-single digit negative in the near term if commodity prices remain where they are.The management said that it is focused on driving what it termed as competitive volume led growth and is stepping up investments behind its brands and long-term strategic priorities.HUL announced a final dividend of Rs 24 per share for FY24 on equity shares of face value of Re 1. The company had earlier paid an interim dividend of Rs 18 per share on November 16, 2023. The total dividend for FY24 amounts to Rs 42 per equity share of face value of Re 1 each.On April 24, HUL's shares on BSE closed trading marginally lower at Rs 2,260.05 apiece.HUL clawing back market share in detergent and skin cleansingThe HUL management said that its market share in the detergent bar and the mass end of the skin cleansing segment is rebounding after a period of decline due to corrective pricing strategies.The company saw the most significant market share reduction in these two categories over the past two years.The management said that during times of relatively high inflation, commodity scarcity, and supply chain constraints, larger players tend to benefit while smaller ones often exit the market. Conversely, during periods of deflation, the situation reverses, with some market share returning to smaller players.In the previous earnings call, Jawa had said in the quarter ended 31 December 2023, \u00a0the trend of local players re-entering the market has largely subsided. Following a period of commodity inflation relief, the fast-moving consumer goods company encountered competition from smaller regional competitors, particularly notable in the tea sector, where consumers were opting for lower-priced alternatives.The company has still been able to hold onto their market share. \u201cIf you look at our performance over the last two years, which includes the inflation and deflation cycle, we have added 200 basis points of market share, which we are broadly holding onto.\u201d said Jawa at the earnings conference on April 24. \u201cThere is some erosion but only slight.\u201d he added.Tiwari added that prices of top three commodities for the company, crude oil, palm oil, and tea are in the range-bound position and benign currently and will not affect volume growth in the coming quarters.Rising A&P spendsMore of the company\u2019s advertising spends are currently focused on digital media, said Jawa. HUL is focusing more on targeted digital advertising like social media and influencer media. He also said spends on traditional media advertising like television is reducing while digital advertising spends are increasing as a proportion of total Advertising & Promotion (A&P) spends.A&P spends for HUL increased by 200 basis points YoY during the January-to-March quarter. The increase in A&P spends was led by a 60 percent increase in digital spends said the company said in its investor presentation.\n       ",

    "Global investors have cut holdings of Hindustan Unilever Ltd. to a four-year low as the company grapples with weak consumer demand and rising competition.Foreign funds reduced their ownership of India\u2019s largest staples company to 12.7% at the end of March, down from as high as 14.5% in June last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The firm\u2019s shares have slumped more than 9% in the past 12 months, the second worst performer in the NSE Nifty 50 Index.Investors have sold Hindustan Unilever and its consumer-giant peers as they found it hard to justify the expensive valuations of the companies amid faltering sales growth. The firm has been facing competition from new-age brands, while lower agricultural yields have sapped demand among its rural customer base.\u201cOverseas investors will look at the parent company trading at less than half the valuation multiple,\u201d said Abhay Agarwal, a fund manager at Piper Serica Advisors Pvt. in Mumbai. Revenue growth has slowed significantly and the \u201cthree-year sideways movement in the stock during a rising market has brought in some wariness,\u201d he said.While foreign funds have been selling, the proportion of Hindustan Unilever\u2019s shares owned by domestic investors has risen to a record 13.2%, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Parent Unilever Plc and other members of the group own just over 60%, while retail investors have about 12%.Local investors have to buy the company given its size and weighting in the benchmark index, Piper Serica\u2019s Agarwal said.Still, the decline in Hindustan Unilever shares this year has helped improve its multiples.

Over the past six months, its share price has sunk around 8.5 percent. In comparison, the Nifty 50 index has gained around 15 percent during the same time period.Rural demand, price cuts to affect volumes, toplineMany players in the FMCG space have undertaken price cuts to boost volumes and increase market share. The price cuts are expected to negatively impact topline growth.Due to lower realisation growth and lack of a sustainable recovery in the rural sector, Hindustan Unilever is expected to see volume growth between 2.5-3 percent for the quarter. Currently, the urban sector is outpacing the rural areas.Additionally, as a result of benign raw material costs, increased competition from unorganised, regional players, larger firms such as HUL\u2019s volumes will be impacted.Royalty payment, GSK deal expiration to impact marginsNuvama Institutional Equities noted that Hindustan Unilever will see an adverse impact of 75 crore on sales for the quarter, as a result of the expiration of GSK consignment arrangement.Hindustan Unilever and GSK Consumer decided to terminate their distribution agreement in 2022.

    "The largest consumer company in the world\u2019s most populous nation has provided everyday products from detergent to instant coffee to Indians for decades.Now Hindustan Unilever Ltd is seeing its fortunes flag as an increasingly sophisticated consumer class with disposable incomes demands more. The Indian unit of Unilever Plc is battling a slowing rate of growth in revenue and profits while its share price is lagging.India\u2019s elite classes are becoming pickier consumers, fueling the success of organic personal-care brands backed by slick social media marketing campaigns. The rise of companies like local upstart Honasa Consumer Ltd, and the inroads made by global names including Estee Lauder Companies Inc. and Clinique Laboratories LLC, is forcing Hindustan Unilever to spend more on product development and advertising.The company\u2019s challenges mirror those of other consumer-goods giants, such as Procter & Gamble Co., L\u2019Oreal SA and its London-based parent, which in recent years have had to acquire the niche brands taking market share from their in-house businesses.\u2018Challenger Brands\u2019\u201cSimply put, the large companies like Hindustan Unilever are slow to move and develop strategies compared to the newer brands that are far more agile,\u201d said Arvind Singhal, chairman of consulting firm Technopak Advisors Pvt. \u201cThe power of large brands is decreasing by the day because there are challenger brands coming up at every price point. They offer better margins to retailers and the local shopkeeper is happy to try them out.\u201dHindustan Unilever declined to comment because it is in an earnings quiet period, a spokesperson said.India\u2019s personal-care sector is estimated to become a $33 billion market by 2027 from $20 billion in 2022, according to Redseer Management Consulting Pvt.The competition for wealthier customers comes as the maker of Dove soaps and Magnum ice cream has also had to offer price cuts for its cheapest brands due to a pullback in spending among the poorer, rural consumers.That\u2019s squeezing the company at both ends, which is often seen as a bellwether for consumer spending in India with its household products sold in every nook and corner of the country.The company\u2019s revenue grew 3 percent during the first nine months of the fiscal year through December \u2014 down from\u00a017\u00a0percent growth\u00a0in the year-ago period. Likewise, net profit is sagging, increasing 4\u00a0percent to 77 billion rupees for the nine month-period ending Dec. 31, compared to 14\u00a0percent growth in the same period in the previous year.The consumer goods maker, meanwhile, spent\u00a048 billion rupees\u00a0($576 million) on advertising and promotional costs in the April to December period, up from 36 billion rupees during the same time last fiscal year.In January, Emkay Global Financial Services Ltd and Centrum Broking Pvt. cut their earnings expectations for Hindustan Unilever. The brokerages had concerns profit margins will be pinched further as it\u2019s forced to devote more resources to fend off new brands in the premium segment.The company has for long benefited from its entrenched on-the-ground supply chain that can fill up shelves at mom-and-pop stores, as well as supermarkets across the country.Direct SalesBut niche competitors selling directly to consumers online circumvent the distribution network, according to Nitin Gupta, an analyst at Emkay Global.\u201cEven when HUL does launch a premium product, they have been late to the market,\u201d Gupta said. \u201cInnovation has not kept pace with the consumer.\u201dThe stock is down by 15 percent since the start of this year, lagging the 4.5\u00a0percent decline in the broad index of consumer stocks in India. The market benchmark, S&P BSE Sensex, has advanced in 2024.Hindustan Unilever is struggling to offer new products in the premium segment that create market buzz, said Vidushi Agrawal, an independent brand consultant based in Mumbai.Tapping InfluencersIts new-age competitors are marketing products to specific demographic groups \u2014 such as young people or new parents \u2014 and tapping social media influencers to spread the word about their brands.Hindustan Unilever personal-care brands such as\u00a0Simple\u00a0or\u00a0Love, Beauty and Planet\u00a0\u2014 launched a few years ago \u2014 are just now gaining some social media traction. Still, each one has garnered less than 92,000 Instagram followers, for example. Mamaearth \u2014 a personal-care brand from newcomer Honasa Consumer \u2014 has more than 1.3 million followers on the platform.Mumbai accountant Karthik M said he now skips by most HUL items on store shelves.

It does not disclose profit for the unit.Still, the company\u2019s fight to maintain its decades-long stranglehold on Indian consumers looks set to intensify.

    "The week ended April 5 favoured the bulls, but the Nifty traded within a range\u00a0of\u00a022,300 to 22,600 points, though it managed to end the week with a gain of 0.84 percent. It, however, failed to close above its previous all-time high of 22,526.60, which raises concerns for the current week.The Nifty is trading above the S3 Camarilla pivot (22,346), and it found support at this level in the previous trading session. Additionally, since the Nifty is trading significantly above its 21-day and 50-day exponential moving averages (DEMA), there is a possibility of reversion towards the next support levels of 22,340 and 22,200.Overall, the levels to watch out for on the higher side would be 22,600 - 22,800 and lower side 22,200\u201322,000.The Nifty Bank index emerged as a notable performer in the past week, gaining almost 1,368 points and closing with a substantial increase of 2.90 percent for the week.Looking ahead, the level of 48,636 poses an immediate resistance as it represents the previous high reached in December 2023. Coincidentally, the 48,600 mark aligns with R5 Camarilla resistance, which could prompt some investors to book profits, potentially leading to a pullback in the Nifty Bank index towards its immediate support levels of 48,000 and 47,500.Here are three buy calls for next 2-3 weeks:Orient Cement: Buy | LTP: Rs 217 | Stop-Loss: Rs 195 | Target: Rs 250 | Return: 15 percentFollowing a peak near the Rs 293 level, Orient Cement encountered a notable downturn, marked by a sharp decline of 35 percent in its overall value. Despite this downturn, Orient Cement has shown signs of stability\u00a0around Rs 200 level for the week, establishing a sustained support base.It's noteworthy that Rs 190-200 level coincides with Fibonacci ratio clustering, as indicated in the chart. Moreover, during this period, a 1:1 leg has also formed around this support zone, further reinforcing a bullish sentiment in the stock.Analysis of the daily scale RSI (relative strength index) indicator reveals a bullish hidden divergence, suggesting a favourable outlook for Orient Cement.Taking into account these factors along with chart patterns, investors may find it prudent to consider initiating buy positions within the range of Rs 210-220, with an upside objective targeted at Rs 250. To manage risk effectively, it's advisable to set a stop-loss order at Rs 195 on a daily closing basis, providing protection against potential downside movements.Hindustan Unilever: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,266.95 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,145 | Target: Rs 2,500 | Return: 10 percentSince reaching its peak around Rs 2,669 mark on January 1, 2024, Hindustan Unilever has experienced a notable downturn, witnessing a significant decline of 16 percent. However, in the subsequent six trading sessions, Hindustan Unilever has displayed resilience, avoiding further declines and instead consolidating within a range spanning from Rs 2,230 to Rs 2,280.Notably, within this price range, a bullish AB=CD pattern has formed on the daily chart of Hindustan Unilever. This range also corresponds with the 0.50 percent retracement level of a price swing observed between March 2022 and July 2023, as depicted on the chart.Additionally, on a daily scale, the relative strength index (RSI) has exhibited a complex structure (W shape) along with some regular bull divergence on the 4-hour chart. Interestingly, the mentioned range of Rs 2,230-2,280 aligns with S3 weekly Camarilla Pivot, suggesting a potentially attractive buying opportunity.Therefore, it might be prudent to consider buying within the range of Rs 2,250-2,280, aiming for an upside target of Rs 2,500, while setting a stop-loss near Rs 2,145 on a daily closing basis.AU Small Finance Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 634.75 | Stop-Loss: Rs 585 | Target: Rs 725 | Return: 14 percentAU Small Finance Bank reached a peak around Rs 813 on January 9, 2024, but then experienced a decline of about 32 percent. However, in the past two weeks, the stock has shown a significant recovery and is currently trading near Rs 620 mark, indicating a bullish sentiment.On the indicator side, the weekly Scale Stochastics indicator has identified a \"hidden Bull Divergence\" close to its previous low point recorded on March 20, 2023 (as shown on the chart).

    "The week ended March 28 proved to be a resounding success for bullish investors in the domestic markets, leading to a highly optimistic closure for the week, month, and the financial year.Despite being truncated because of two national holidays, the Nifty index consistently traded in the positive territory across sessions. Throughout the last week, there were notable attempts by the benchmark to surpass the significant 22,500 mark, indicating a strong bullish sentiment in the market, although it ultimately closed below this threshold.The last week, however, concluded with gains of over a percent, reflecting the positive momentum and sentiment among investors. Overall, it was a week marked by optimism and upward momentum, underscoring the resilience and confidence in the domestic markets.Last week, our analysis centered around the crucial support of the 50-day exponential moving average (DEMA) for the Nifty index. Additionally, we delved into the bullish harmonic shark pattern and the morning star candlestick pattern. The impact of these technical indicators was evidently observed throughout the week, as they contributed to pulling the index back to the significant 22,500 mark.However, a notable occurrence during the final hour of the preceding trading session led to a substantial pullback, driving the index towards the 22,300 mark, prompting a degree of scepticism in our outlook. Despite our prior bullish stance, we now anticipate fresh rounds of buying activity only if the index surpasses the 22,500 level or nears the 22,100 levels, owing to the emergence of negative divergence in the relative strength index (RSI) across multiple time frames. This divergence signifies a potential short-term reversal in momentum.For the medium term, we maintain our optimistic outlook, asserting that as long as the support at 21,700 remains intact, the index retains the potential for further upward movement. Looking ahead, the short-term support level has been adjusted to 22,000 for the current week starting from April 1, underscoring the dynamic nature of market trends and the importance of vigilant analysis in navigating fluctuations.Here are three buy calls for the next 2-3 weeks:Orient Cement: Buy | LTP: Rs 196 | Stop-Loss: Rs 179 | Target: Rs 225 | Return: 15 percentFollowing a peak near the Rs 293 level, Orient Cement encountered a notable downturn, marked by a sharp decline of 35 percent in its overall value. Despite this downturn, Orient Cement has shown signs of stabilisation around Rs 190 levels for the last week, establishing a sustained support base.It's noteworthy that the level of Rs 190 aligns with the Fibonacci ratio clustering, as indicated in the chart. Moreover, during this period, a 1:1 leg has also formed around this support zone, further reinforcing a bullish sentiment in the stock. An analysis of the daily scale RSI indicator reveals a bullish hidden divergence, suggesting a favourable outlook for Orient Cement.Taking into account these factors along with chart patterns, investors may find it prudent to consider initiating buy positions within the range of Rs 190-198, with an upside objective of Rs 225. To manage the risks effectively, it's advisable to set a stop-loss order at Rs 179 on a daily closing basis, providing protection against potential downside movements.ABB India: Buy | LTP: Rs 6,361 | Stop-Loss: Rs 5,950 | Target: Rs 7,000 | Return: 10 percentIn the recent trading session, ABB India showed a significant breakout above the R4 camarilla pivot (Rs 6,111.4), maintaining its position above this level. Additionally, daily stochastics have ventured into the overbought territory, suggesting a bullish momentum anticipated in the upcoming days.The combination of price action persisting above the R4 camarilla pivot and stochastics registering as overbought presents a compelling technical confluence, reinforcing the bullish sentiment surrounding ABB India.Investors may consider initiating a 'buy' position within the range of Rs 6,250-6,400, targeting an upside potential of Rs 7,000, while prudently placing a stop-loss near Rs 5,950 based on the daily closing prices.Hindustan Unilever: Buy | LTP: Rs 2,264 | Stop-Loss: Rs 2,145 | Target: Rs 2,500 | Return: 10 percentSince reaching its peak around the Rs 2,669 mark on January 1, 2024, Hindustan Unilever has experienced a notable downturn, witnessing a significant decline of approximately 16 percent.
