    "Nifty took investors on a wild ride this week as it climbed steadily throughout the week but surrendered most of its gains on April 12 due to concerns about rising US inflation, delay in interest rate cuts, and heightened geopolitical tensions. The coming week will be crucial for the market as fresh worries regarding the Israel-Iran conflict emerge.Iran launched its first direct attack on Israel with explosive drones and missiles on April 13, raising a threat to security and peace in the Gulf region. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that Israel has been preparing for a direct attack by Iran.The event also garnered attention from leaders around the globe. Any significant escalation in tensions may incite panic selling and heighten volatility in global stock markets, said analysts.Also Read |\u00a0Israel-Iran tensions: How should investors navigate the impact on financial market?In the upcoming holiday-truncated week, investors will be watching for developments in the Middle East. Here are some stocks that will remain in focus due to escalating tensions between Israel and Iran.1. Adani Ports: Adani Ports owns the Haifa port in northern Israel. It completed the purchase in January 2024 for about US$ 1.03 billion and operates the port with a local partner. Although the war has not yet impacted the port in any way, a broader escalation in the conflict could make critical infrastructure within Israel, such as this port, a potential target.2. Sun Pharma: Sun Pharma\u2019s subsidiary, Taro, is an Israeli firm. If some of the staff is potentially called for active duty in the war, it could impact production to an extent but it is unlikely to have a big impact on Sun Parma\u2019s overall consolidated financials.3. OMC stocks: If the Iran-Israel conflict deepens, it is expected to drive crude prices higher to potentially hitting $100 per barrel in the near future. This may directly hit the stock of Oil Market Companies (OMCs) such as Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL), Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL).These scrips may see increased volatility as higher crude prices not only put pressure on marketing margins but also lead to a rise in working capital requirements since OMCs import crude oil to meet the country's petroleum products demand. As crude prices rise, they need to spend more on imports.4. Paint Stocks: Whenever crude oil prices go up, the paint sector is hit hard as the main inputs in the manufacture of paints are crude oil derivatives. These companies have no control over these input prices.If tensions in the Middle East escalate pushing crude price to above $100 per barrel, stocks of paint manufacturers like Akzo Nobel India, Berger Paints, Indigo Paints, and Shalimar Paints may come under pressure as crude derivatives account for almost 40 percent of the input bill for these paint manufacturers. A rise in the price of crude can mean narrower profit margins.Also Read |\u00a0Israel-Iran escalating tension to trigger correction in equities? Check Nifty, Bank Nifty levels to watch5. Tyre stocks: Since the tyre industry uses crude oil derivatives for manufacturing synthetic rubber, several tyre stocks including MRF, CEAT, Apollo Tyres, JK Tyres, and Goodyear Tire & Rubber India will remain in focus as a rise in crude price will hit their margins.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "As the investigations into Adani Group stocks found no wrongdoings, S&P Global on January 22 upgraded its outlook on Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd.

(AEML) to stable from negative while affirming their credit ratings.Regulatory investigations done by the market regulator SEBI and Supreme Court have mostly concluded without proving wrongdoing on alleged governance matters raised in a short-seller report released in January 2023. The report alleged non-compliance of minimum public shareholding, non-disclosures of related party transactions, or stock price manipulation, among others. All allegations were denied by Adani Group.\u201cThe stable outlook reflects strong business fundamentals and robust cash flows for AEML and APSEZ in the next 12 to 24 months. We also expect the rated entities to not undertake significant related-party transactions outside the normal course of business,\u201d said S&P Global in a release.S&P said it believes the conclusion of most regulatory investigations into the Adani Group without evidence of wrongdoing has reduced downside risk. It added though that the group remains exposed to some governance risks as part of a large family-owned conglomerate with ambitious growth plans and related-party transactions.Repayment of all promoter loans linked to share prices, equity, and bank loans raised by multiple group entities at competitive rates reflects restored access to funding, the rating agency said, adding both companies enjoy good competitive positions, healthy cash flows, and adequate liquidity to meet their debt-servicing requirements.Earlier this month, the Supreme Court of India issued a judgement confirming that Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) had completed its investigation of 22 of the 24 allegations against the Adani portfolio entities without any adverse findings. SEBI will complete its investigation of the two remaining allegations, relating to Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPI), within the next three months.\u201cWe do not expect the outcomes of the two pending matters to weigh on the group's governance and funding profiles. We note that SEBI investigated similar issues in 2020, without closing the investigation,\u201d S&P said.S&P Global said it expects AEML's operating cash flow (OCF) to debt to recover to about 14.5 percent in FY24 and decline slightly to 12.2 percent in FY25. Higher power demand, stable tariff collections, and an approved \"true-up\" amount of Indian rupee (INR) 15.7 billion would drive this recovery.\u201cWe forecast APSEZ's ratio of funds from operations (FFO) to debt to increase to 21-24 percent over FY24-25 from about 18.5 percent in FY23. This will be driven by higher earnings led by cargo volume growth, tariff escalations, commissioning of new projects, and expansion of its logistics business,\u201d the rating agency added.S&P said full-year earnings contributions from assets acquired in fiscal 2023, such as Haifa Port Co. (HPC) and Karaikal Port and Ocean Sparkle Ltd. will also support this growth. It expects the company's ratio of net debt to EBITDA to be 3.1x to 3.4x over FY24-25.\n       ",
