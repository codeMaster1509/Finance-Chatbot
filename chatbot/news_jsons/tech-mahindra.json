    "Sharekhan's research report on Tech MahindraThe management has outlined a strategic plan over the next three years to enhance the company\u2019s sustainability and predictability in terms of growth and profitability. The company aims to achieve a turnaround in FY25, stabilize in FY26 and start reaping returns in FY27. The company aims to achieve topline growth above peers in FY27 with an EBIT margin exceeding 15% while achieving $250 million in savings each year for the next three years. Additionally, the company\u2019s focus would be to drive organic growth and build internal capabilities to reach the FY27 milestone. The company aims to reach an operating margin of 15% in FY27 from 6.1% in FY24 using margin levers such as fresher hirings, Subcon optimization, offshore mix, and utilization, among others. Cost savings under Project Fortius is going to be the big driver to drive a $250m average savings per year.OutlookWhile the near-term macro uncertainties would provide limited headroom for growth and margin recovery until FY25. However, the well-defined and articulated roadmap for FY27 outlines the company\u2019s focused vision, with the ultimate key being execution. Further, the company\u2019s strategy to diversify its portfolio, lessen reliance on the CME vertical, and pursue growth opportunities in other key sectors are steps in the right direction and should offset the persisting weakness in the communication vertical while emerging as credible competitor in other verticals especially Financial services. We have upgraded the company to Buy with a revised price target of Rs. 1,715 (raised target multiple to 25xFY26E) to factor probable business recovery on account of a well-defined and articulated roadmap for FY27 supported by gradually receding headwinds and leveraging of the group\u2019s synergies and ecosystems.

    "Indian IT stocks were unfazed\u00a0on June 21, with TCS, Infosys, HCL Technologies, Wipro, LTIMindtree rising over 1 percent each even after Accenture narrowed its revenue guidance for FY24 due to macroeconomic uncertainties. Analysts see Accenture's Q3 results as slightly positive for domestic IT stocks, thanks to a rise in small deals and a rebound in consulting growth.So far this year, shares of Tech Mahindra and Wipro have surged up to 9 percent, while Infosys and TCS have slipped by up to 1 percent. In comparison, the benchmark Nifty 50 index has surged by 8 percent during the same period.Morgan Stanley highlighted some positive data points from Accenture's Q3 results, including the return to growth in strategy and consulting, and an increase in smaller deals. However, they remain cautious about the return of discretionary spending, noting it is still 'elusive.'ALSO READ:\u00a0Accenture lowers revenue forecast again as tough macro economy weighsNomura, too, retained a cautious stance on the revival of discretionary spending but is optimistic about order book growth driven by large projects. Accenture's new order bookings rose by 22 percent YoY in Q3, driven by 23 large deals worth over $100 million each. Bookings in consulting and managed services increased by 4 percent and 2 percent, respectively.\"While revenue growth for large-caps should improve in FY25F (+2.9 percent YoY vs FY24F (+1.3 percent YoY), we expect it to be driven by cost take-out deals. We have a\u00a0'buy'\u00a0rating on Tech Mahindra in largecaps and Coforge, Birlasoft, eClerx in midcaps. Conversely, we have a 'reduce' rating on TCS, Wipro, LTIMindtree, and Mphasis,\" Nomura added.Similarly, analysts at Kotak Institutional Equities expect some elation in Indian IT stocks. \"Strong bookings numbers and acceleration in growth rates from a decline to a positive aided by inorganic growth may spur some excitement given the buoyancy of the sector on any positive indications on demand,\" they said.Accenture's Q3 revenue was $16.47 billion, down from $16.56 billion a year ago, with flat operating margins YoY. The company, which follows a September-August financial year, tightened its full-year revenue guidance to 1.5-2.5 percent from the previous 1-3 percent. Given that a significant portion of Accenture's workforce is based in India, its results are often seen as indicative of broader trends in the Indian IT sector.Going ahead,\u00a0Accenture expects revenue growth from the consulting business to turn positive in Q4FY24 after five consecutive quarters of a\u00a0YoY decline.\u00a0Accenture noted that, while the industry\u2019s long-term technology spending trends remain intact, client cautiousness due to macro uncertainties is weighing on tech spending in the near-term.ALSO READ:\u00a0Accenture\u2019s tepid outlook implies more pain for Indian IT even in FY25Having said that, the company's artificial intelligence (GenAI) portfolio continued to grow,\u00a0with bookings reaching $900 million for the quarter, contributing to a total of $2 billion in bookings \u2014 the largest in the IT services industry.\u00a0Accenture and TCS are the only two big IT companies that have so far declared revenue from this nascent technology.Nomura analysts believe that this rise in GenAI signalled enterprises need to further invest in cloud adoption and data standardisation to harness its true potential. \"It views GenAI as any other new technology wave and hence, would adopt previously proven playbook of being an early mover in investing in the technology and advising clients, and adopting the tech,\" they noted.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "IT companies within the Nifty 50 index -- Tech Mahindra, LTIMindtree, HCL Tech, and TCS -- dominated the list of stocks that saw a surge in rating upgrades by brokerages over the last three months (March-May). Despite continuing to face challenges such as muted demand and weak discretionary spending, analysts believe that IT stocks have potentially bottomed out, reaching a favourable buying position.Tech Mahindra witnessed the most substantial increase in upgrades, with 'Buy' calls rising from 13 to 22 in the previous quarter. TCS followed suit with a notable increase of 4 'Buy' calls, reaching a total of 29, the highest among its peers. Similarly, LTIMindtree and HCL Tech each received 3 additional 'Buy' calls, bringing their tally to 16 and 21, respectively.According to the IT sector's Q4 FY24 financial results, BFSI, retail, hi-tech, and communication verticals showed persistent weakness, while manufacturing, energy, and utilities fared relatively better. The FY25 revenue guidance also fell short of expectations, indicating a slower recovery path towards normalisation. However, the earnings were on expected lines, with no unusual surprises, said experts.On the upside, margins improved in Q4 FY24 for most companies (except HCL Tech and LTIMindtree) due to higher utilisation, an offshore shift, and reduced discretionary expenses.Market experts are bullish on IT stocks, citing several reasons for their optimism. These factors highlight a potential resurgence in the sector and its attractiveness to investors.Comfortable valuationsMarket experts believe that IT stocks have bottomed out and are now at attractive valuations.Emkay Global noted that the correction in IT stock prices over the last few months has made valuations more reasonable. \"We prefer large caps over mid-caps, considering relative valuation,\" the brokerage said, adding that its top picks in large caps include Infosys, HCL Tech, Wipro, Tech Mahindra, TCS, and LTIMindtree.\"IT counters have not performed in the last 1.5-2 years. I think it is time for them to lead the rally from here,\" said Kunal Rambhia, Fund Manager & Trading Strategist at The Streets.Per technical indicators, the BSE IT index had a very strong support zone at 33,300, from where the buying is expected to continue until 36,000-36,500. On Friday, 7 June, the IT index jumped 3.4 percent to end at 35,909. After delivering negative monthly returns from March to May, the index has gained over 8 percent in June.Strong deal pipelineThe deal pipeline remained robust across the IT industry in Q4 FY24. Total Contract Value (TCV) growth was strong, despite a slight moderation due to fewer mega deals signed by Tier-1 players. Infosys and TCS reported strong bookings, bolstered by large and mega deals, while Wipro and Tech Mahindra experienced muted TCV.\"A positive aspect reported was that deal sizes and wins were on a good, comfortable trajectory, providing visibility for the next year,\" said Rishubh Vasa, Research Analyst at Indsec Securities & Finance.Political uncertainty shifts investment focus to ITWith the Indian general election results not coming in as expected, it has led to concerns that the new government could struggle to accomplish its goals without a full majority. This has put pressure on infrastructure spending and government investments. As a result, funds would now flow into the IT sector.US interest rate cut speculations: A potential boonGrowing hope of a rate cut by the US Federal Reserve has triggered a fall in US bond yields, positively impacting IT stocks. Lower bond yields generally create a favourable environment for IT stocks due to reduced borrowing costs and shifts in investor preferences toward growth-oriented investments.Interest rate cuts will ease client pressure and boost spending, benefiting the IT sector, said Vasa. However, these cuts will take time and likely begin after the US general elections clarify the political landscape.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "Shares of information technology companies were trading firmly in the green on May 16 after a softer-than-expected US April inflation print fanned hopes of a rate cut by the Federal Reserve in September.In addition, the growing hopes of a September rate cut also triggered a fall in US bond yields, which was another positive for IT stocks. A decrease in bond yields generally creates a favourable environment for IT\u00a0stocks due to lower borrowing costs, increased present valuations, and shifts in investor preferences toward growth-oriented investments.Consequently, shares of HCLTech, LTIMindtree, Infosys, Coforge, Tech Mahindra, L&T Technology and Mphasis rose 1-3 percent. The uptick in IT stocks lifted the Nifty IT index over a percent higher to register its biggest gains in two months.Follow our market blog for live updatesThe US inflation print rose 0.3 percent on month in April, lower than the Dow Jones estimate of a 0.4\u00a0percent spike. The softer inflation print, after three straight months of hotter-than-expected inflation growth came as a breather for global markets. It also fueled hopes that it might now give the US central bank the leeway to charter its rate cutting trajectory from September.As per the CME FedWatch tool, investors are now pricing in a\u00a053.1 percent possibility of getting a rate-cut in September, higher than the\u00a046.3 percent expectation a month ago.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

    "The stock market halted its downtrend on Friday and Nifty 50 managed to defend the 21,900 mark. As long as the index holds this level, the rangebound trade may continue, with attempts towards\u00a022,200-22,300. If it closes below 21,900, Nifty 50 may then correct up to April lows of 21,776, according to experts.The 21,900 mark coincides with the rising support trendline, low of the big bearish candle on May 9 as well as the lower end of the Bollinger band.Overall, the trend is still in control of the bears. For the week ended May 10, the Nifty 50 fell 1.87 percent to 22,055 and formed a large bearish candlestick pattern on the weekly timeframe following Doji candlestick pattern formation in the previous session.\"Thursday's low coinciding with the 89EMA at 21,900 serves as immediate support, followed by previous swing lows in the 21,800 - 21,700 range,\" Rajesh Bhosale, technical analyst at Angel One.On the upside, the zone between the 20 and 50EMA, around 22,200 - 22,300 presents a formidable obstacle, he feels.Jigar S Patel, senior manager - equity research at Anand Rathi said the index is nearing the lower boundary of an upward channel, and a breach could signal deeper market concerns. \"Looking ahead, a drop below 21,900, the previous swing low of 21,777, may induce market panic.\"Conversely, the FIIs' long-short ratio in index futures at around 32 percent suggests an oversold market nearing a potential rebound. Hence, he feels the resistance is expected at 22,300, and closing above the same may be potentially confirming a bottom until election results.He advised traders to remain light from here on as the market is now approaching the final phases of the election.Moneycontrol collated a list of top 10 stock picks\u00a0recommended by experts\u00a0from\u00a0a\u00a03-4 week perspective.

Analysts at Mirae Asset recently highlighted the management's three-year strategic roadmap of \"improving profitability, new capital allocation plans and higher RoCE of more than 30 percent.\"Mirae sees FY25 to be a year of turnaround for the company and the company continuing the journey next year by concentrating on more business from the most important clients and cutting down costs.Mirae Asset upgraded their recommendation on the stock from \"hold\" to \"add.\"Another tech stock that gained favour with analysts was TCS. It had 28 buy calls, compared to 22 buy calls during the same period last year.The number of hold calls fell from 13 to 10 while sell calls stayed steady at 10.Analysts at JP Morgan said that they believe the stock is a cross-cycle champion that will benefit from \"cost takeout deals in the short term and discretionary digital transformation deals in the medium term\".The brokerage firm feels there's room for profit margins to grow, and it expects earnings to increase by 4 percent due to an 80 basis points improvement in margins this year.The stock with the third most upgrades during the quarter was Hindustan Unilever.\u00a0In a March 2024 report on consumption, analysts at BNP Paribas noted that the home care division was now seeing higher competitive intensity. \"While the near-term growth prospects appear muted, margin improvement is set to drive earnings growth,\u201d the report said.

Similarly, analysts at DAM Capital also downgraded the stock to a sell as they believed that UPL's realisations would continue to remain under pressure.MOSL analysts had downgraded Tata Motors to \u2018neutral\u2019 in March as they saw limited upside to the stock because of the price factoring in most of the positive triggers.As per Moneycontrol's analyst tracker, the stock has 24 buy calls, 4 hold calls and 5 sell calls against 28 buy calls, 2 hold call and 4 sell calls.

    "Indian IT services majors reported soft but broadly in-line Q4 results, with the outlook for FY25 not inspiring much confidence either. Hence, Moneycontrol's list of companies with maximum \u2018sell\u2019 calls or maximum pessimism features three IT stocks, including Wipro and LTIMindtree.According to analysts at Kotak Securities, demand outlook and macro uncertainty continue to be weak in FY25. This has led to a reset of both growth and margin expectations, which in turn has led to muted growth guidance for all IT firms, and a weaker margin outlook for some.\"Recovery hopes have been pushed back to FY26,\" the brokerage said. However, stock price corrections in the past few months have made valuations more palatable, it added.Follow our market blog to catch all the live actionMoneycontrol analysis shows that out of the 46 analysts that have coverage on Wipro stock, 24 have a 'sell' call, 13 have a 'hold' call, and only 9 analysts are bullish with 'buy' calls. The pessimism stems from the fact that Wipro has been underperforming compared to the rest of its large-cap IT peers.Analysts do not expect this trend to reverse anytime soon as the company continues to face challenges from a subdued economic environment.Why is Wipro the company with maximum pessimism in April?1. Weak guidance: The weak revenue growth guidance by Wipro's management for Q1FY25 at -1.5- 0.5 percent in constant currency (CC) terms was slightly disappointing, according to Sharekhan. Further the sudden change in CEO adds another layer of delay in recovery in the near-term before the potential turnaround in the medium- to long-term.2. Demand, discretionary slowdown: Wipro's management said that the market has not changed fundamentally in terms of demand. Although it is witnessing some stabilisation in BFSI, the slowdown in discretionary spending continues, especially in smaller projects. It is said that near-term margins are likely to remain range-bound.3. CEO change: In April 2024, Thierry Delaporte resigned as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Wipro\u00a0and he was\u00a0replaced by Srinivas Pallia, a 32-year veteran of the company. Motilal Oswal expects its FY25 revenue growth to be one of the lowest among Tier-1 IT Services peers.\"We reiterate our Neutral rating as we look forward to: 1) the execution under the new CEO, and 2) a successful turnaround from its struggles over the last decade, before turning more constructive on the stock,\" the brokerage said.4. Execution lag: Axis Securities said that Wipro lags in execution capabilities to capitalise on growth compared to peers, despite a strong deal pipeline and superior financial structure.5. Deal conversion lag: The slower ramp-up in large deals, delay in executions, and lack of immediate mega deal alternatives would keep Wipro's top-line growth unstable, said Prabhudas Lilladher.\"The conversion from TCV to revenue remains a challenge, as the larger part of its portfolio has high concentration on discretionary spends which is weighing on its performance due to project ramp down, and in some cases, it is difficult to replenish the projects that are having similar size and scope,\" it said.It is worth noting that while several brokerages have maintained a 'sell' or 'hold' rating on Wipro, they have raised the target price on the stock given in-line revenue, EBITDA Margin, PAT, and deal wins in Q4.Also Read |\u00a0Hindustan Zinc stock soars 11% to 52-week high as positive China data lifts zinc pricesOther IT firms with maximum pessimism in AprilMoneycontrol analysis shows that LTIMindtree and Tech Mahindra are other IT stocks that saw maximum pessimism in the month gone by.Out of the 41 analysts that have a coverage on LTIMindtree, 15 have a 'sell' rating, 10 hold, and 16 have a 'buy' call on the stock, translating to a 61-percent pessimism. As for Tech Mahindra, of the 45 brokerages, 14 have a 'sell' call, 10 hold, and 21 'buy' calls.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.

'Buy' calls on Tech Mahindra stock increased from 14 to 21, while 'hold' calls dropped to 10 from 13 and \u2018sell\u2019 calls dropped to 14 from 18.In its Q4 earnings, Tech Mahindra spelt out a three-year plan to achieve over 15\u00a0percent\u00a0growth in operating profit and higher revenues by 2026-27, focusing on client accounts, restructuring, and new investments.Brokerages noted Tech Mahindra's efforts to address client-specific engagement issues and maintain a solid deal pipeline. However, uncertainty in demand could impact revenue growth momentum in the near term.Medium-term outlook positive\u00a0Morgan Stanley double upgraded Tech Mahindra's rating from \u2018underweight\u2019 to \u2018overweight\u2019, and increased its price target to Rs 1,490 from Rs 1,190. The brokerage sees Tech Mahindra's medium-term outlook as positive, with growth, margins, and capital allocation supporting the floor at Rs 1,150.Describing it as a \u2018self-help story\u2019, Morgan Stanley highlighted the management's clear vision till fiscal year 2027. Key catalysts include margin improvement, revenue growth, and diversification away from the Telecom vertical.Domestic brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher too highlighted the growth strategy that aims to diversify the portfolio away from communication business towards high-growth service lines and scaling up major accounts.But execution challenges lingerHSBC viewed Tech Mahindra's new turnaround plan as sensible but added that the challenge lies in its execution amid the current macroeconomic conditions. The brokerage said that margin expansion depends on pyramid improvement and maintaining average pricing, considering the lacklustre sector outlook. HSBC kept its 'hold' rating on the stock with a price target of Rs 1,300.Similarly, Nuvama expressed caution regarding Tech Mahindra's ambitious targets, foreseeing significant near-term challenges in achieving them. The brokerage said that the steps required will entail substantial short-term pain.

Consolidated revenue for Q4FY24 fell 6.2\u00a0percent\u00a0year-on-year to Rs 12,871 crore.Emkay noted the company's emphasis on its 'Speed at scale' strategy, focusing on scaling large accounts, leveraging synergies from past acquisitions, upgrading cost structures significantly, and enhancing organisational predictability.The company management views FY25 as a turnaround year, followed by a stable performance in FY26, with full benefits realised by FY27. The company is eyeing an operating margin of 15\u00a0percent\u00a0by FY27, expecting average benefits of $250 million annually.Meanwhile, major IT stocks like Infosys, TCS, HCL Tech, Wipro, and LTI Mindtree witnessed minimal changes in brokerage calls post-earnings. Infosys currently has 33 buy calls, 8 holds, and 7 sells, slightly up from 31 buys, 8 holds and 7 sells a month ago.Similarly, TCS saw its buy calls increase from 26 to 28, while hold and sell calls remained unchanged at 10 each from last month. Wipro's current figures stand at 9 buys, 13 holds, and 24 sells, compared to 9 buys, 13 holds, and 22 sells earlier.HCL Tech's current numbers are 21 buys, 15 holds, and 7 sells, compared to 20 buys, 15 holds, and 9 sells previously.
