    "Bharti Airtel reported on August 5 that its Q1 FY25 net profit swelled 158 percent year-on-year to Rs 4,160 crore from Rs 1,612 crore in the corresponding quarter last year, beating Street expectations. This was mainly helped by exceptional items. Consolidated net profit before exceptional items for the first quarter was Rs 2,925 crore.During the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the net exceptional gain of Rs 735 crore comprised a gain of Rs 1,399.1 crore on account of a favourable judgement by the Supreme Court of India regarding the waiver of interest on the tax treatment of adjusted revenue-linked variable license fee payable to DoT.The net exceptional gain also includes a gain of Rs 274 crore pertaining to the divestment of Airtel Lanka, offset by a charge on account of a foreign exchange loss of Rs 938.7 crore due to currency devaluation in its group subsidiaries. Airtel said that the net tax benefit on the above exceptional item is Rs 328 crore.The telecom major\u2019s revenue for the April-June quarter rose 2.8 percent on-year to Rs\u00a038,506 crore from Rs 37,440 crore, which the company said was limited due to currency devaluation in Africa.A Moneycontrol poll of 5 brokerage estimates pegged Bharti Airtel\u2019s fiscal first quarter net profit at Rs 3,455 crore, and revenue at Rs 38,611 crore.The average revenue per user (ARPU) per month, an important metric used by telecom companies to measure revenue generation, increased 5.5 percent year-on-year to Rs 211, from Rs 200 a year ago.Kotak Institutional Equities expected ARPU to marginally increase to Rs 210 in Q1FY25 compared to Rs 209 in the previous quarter. However, the recent tariff hikes will take a couple of quarters to fully reflect on the realisation. Axis Securities expected a 15 percent ARPU gain in Q3FY25, with a combination of higher conversion and tariff hikes.Airtel's subscriber base reached 409 million in the quarter.

Africa continues to deliver strong underlying constant currency revenue growth,\"\u00a0Gopal Vittal, MD of Airtel, said in a statement.He said that during the quarter, Airtel accelerated the pace of FWA services expansion across key towns, which would expand the addressable market.The homes business delivered a revenue growth of 17.6% YoY, driven by healthy customer additions. Airtel said its focus on digitization and acquiring high-value customers led to 348,000 customer additions in the quarter, bringing the total base to 8.0 million.\"We continue to expand our home-pass network through our own and asset-light local cable operator partnership model. Our WiFi services are now live in 1317 cities,\" Vittal said.Airtel Business delivered revenue growth of 8.3% YoY,\u00a0led by growth in underlying domestic portfolio.Revenue from Digital TV remained stable, with a 16.3 million customer base at the end of the quarter.\u00a0 Digital TV revenues up by 5.0% YoY, led by customer additions and rationalization improvementIn the recently concluded spectrum auction, Airtel renewed the spectrum expiring in 6 circles and further bolstered our sub-giga hertz and mid-band holding in key circles by investing Rs 6,857 crores.\"The industry saw much-needed action on tariff repair, which is positive for the industry\u2019s financial health amid ongoing large network capex.

    "Telecom major Bharti Airtel on Monday said it has started reallocating its existent mid-band spectrum to accommodate the exponential growth in 5G traffic.As data demand grows, Airtel is re-farming its existing spectrum at a faster pace to provide its customers with a brilliant 5G experience, it said.\"With more customers moving to the 5G network, Airtel is re-farming its mid-band spectrum to expand 5G services on its 1800, 2100, 2300 MHz bands across the country,\" it said in a statement.Airtel said its pilot on the SA and NSA switch conducted in Rewari, Chennai and Bhubaneswar showed encouraging results.This capability on the 5G network will enable Airtel to introduce new innovative applications, services and solutions through open APIs, differentiated connectivity and service-based architecture, it said.\"As more customers pivot to our 5G services, we have re-farmed our mid-band spectrum which was being used for 4G services.

    "Bharti Airtel's Africa unit Airtel Africa has reported a consolidated net profit of USD 7 million for the June 2024 quarter against a USD 170 million loss in the year-ago period.Its net profit was primarily impacted by the USD 80 million of exceptional derivative and foreign exchange losses (net of tax) and lower EBITDA due to significant currency devaluation across key markets, Airtel Africa said.It had reported a loss of USD 91 million for the fourth quarter ended March 2024 on account of tax impact and forex loss.\"Strong fundamentals and focussed execution continue to support operating performance despite challenging macro-economic environment,\" the company, which operates in 14 African countries, said.The company's consolidated revenue fell 16 per cent in Q1 FY25 to USD 1,156 million from USD 1,377 million a year ago.The decline in revenue reflects the impact of currency devaluation, particularly in Nigeria, the company said.\"We have initiated a comprehensive cost optimisation programme across the Group. We have already seen success in this project, with savings arising in network and distribution costs, and continued opportunities as contract renegotiations continue. We expect sustainable savings to continue as the year progresses,\" said Airtel Africa CEO Sunil Taldar.Airtel Africa has fully repaid the outstanding debt due at the HoldCo during Q1, he said, adding that the company is trying to further reduce foreign currency exposure to limit the impact of currency devaluation on the business.\"The growth opportunity across our markets remains compelling, and we continue to focus on margin improvement as indicated in our FY24 results,\" Taldar said.The company's EBITDA margins tanked to 45.3 per cent from 49.5 per cent in the year-ago period.\"Reported currency trends were clearly impacted by the FX headwinds across some of our markets, particularly in Nigeria and Malawi. This contributed to a reported Group revenue and EBITDA decline of 16.1 per cent and 23.3 per cent, respectively, in Q125,\" the company said.Its total customer base grew by 8.6 per cent to 155.4 million.\"Data customer penetration continues to rise, driving a 13.4 per cent increase in data customers to 64.4 million. Data usage per customer increased by 25.1 per cent to 6.2 GBs, with smartphone penetration increasing 4.7 per cent to reach 41.7 per cent,\" the company said.\n       ",

    "Brokerage firm Investec raised its price target for Bharti Airtel stock by a whopping 60.5 percent to Rs 1,560, while retaining its hold call as it sees the telecom major a steady path of deleveraging. This comes after Bharti Airtel, along with its rivals Reliance Jio and Vodafone Idea, recently announced tariff hikes of 20-25 percent, in a bid to boost their average revenue per user (ARPU) and profitability.Investec expects tariff hikes like these could become an annual affair for telcos for the next few years.\u00a0These\u00a0price hikes, according to Investec are slated\u00a0to benefit the\u00a0all players within the sector by improving ARPU and enhancing return on capital employed (RoCE), ultimately aiding in debt reduction.Analysts at BofA Securities seconded the view and\u00a0stated that the recent round of tariff hikes would enhance cash flows and return ratios across the telecom sector. \"Vodafone Idea will be the biggest beneficiary of the tariff hike, as it is a pure-play mobile operator, followed by Bharti Airtel and then Reliance Jio,\"\u00a0the brokerage said.Other analysts on the Street also share a similar view and see price hikes in a positive light. Previously, Morgan Stanley\u00a0had\u00a0estimated blended ARPU for\u00a0Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio to benefit 16-18 percent\u00a0from these tariff hikes.Analysts at Bernstein\u00a0also projected that the recent tariff hike will help Bharti Airtel's average revenue per user (ARPU) stabilise to over Rs 280 by FY26 and reach Rs 300 by FY27.Currently, Airtel boasts the highest ARPU in the market at Rs 209, followed by Jio at Rs 181.7 and Vodafone Idea at Rs 146, as of the end of Q4 of FY24.Follow our live blog for all the updatesBharti Airtel also stated\u00a0the importance of its ARPU surpassing Rs 300 for the financial health of the telecom sector in India. \"We believe that this level of ARPU will enable the substantial investments required in network technology and spectrum and offer a modest return on capital,\" the telecom firm stated.Investec also feels the current market structure in the telecom industry appears better placed to drive improved pricing.In addition to Bharti Airtel, Investec also initiated coverage on Bharti Hexacom with a 'buy' call, assigning it a target price of Rs 1,240, implying an upside of around 18 percent from the previous closing price. The firm also believes the company is better placed to benefit from tariff hikes.Investec also lauded Reliance Jio's growth as it stands close to achieving its stated target of reaching 50 crore subscribers. However, the brokerage feels incremental growth for the company will be driven more by a spike in ARPUs rather than subscriber addition.Also Read |\u00a0Airtel, Jio to see 16-18% ARPU benefit from tariff hikes, Vodafone Idea may gain most: AnalystsDisclosure: Moneycontrol is a part of the Network18 group.

    "Telecom major Bharti Airtel has denied any breach of its security system, amid reports of a major data leak of customers belonging to the telecom player.\u201cThere has been a report alleging that Airtel customer data has been compromised. This is nothing short of a desperate attempt to tarnish Airtel\u2019s reputation by vested interests. We have done a thorough investigation and can confirm that there has been no breach whatsoever from Airtel systems.\u201d an Airtel spokesperson told Moneycontrol, clarifying on the reports of data breach that have been doing the round\u00a0since yesterday.Unverified reports had suggested that details of 375 million Airtel customers, including their phone number, email, address\u00a0and Aadhaar number were allegedly available for sale on the dark web.

    "Singapore\u2019s telecom major Singtel may divest more stake in India\u2019s second-largest carrier Bharti Airtel,\u00a0people\u00a0familiar with the matter said.\u00a0In March, it sold 0.8 per cent to GQG Partners for Rs 5,849 crore.Singtel's next round of share sales could see the Singapore telco sell\u00a0equity\u00a0worth as much as Rs 20,000 crore in one or more block deals.The people cited said that Singtel has a plan to\u00a0bring down its stake\u00a0in the carrier\u00a0over time to the same level\u00a0as\u00a0the\u00a0promoters, the\u00a0Bharti Group. Bharti Group\u2019s current effective stake stands at 24.57%.They added that Singtel is working with investment bank Morgan Stanley on the stake sale and while talks with prospective buyers were already ongoing, any block deal or deals are now likely to happen only after the company\u2019s results for the first quarter of FY25, due to Sebi restrictions on share trading by promoters and key managerial people from the end of the quarter till 48 hours after the publishing of quarterly results.Queries sent to Airtel, Singtel and Morgan Stanley didn\u2019t elicit any response.The GQG deal in March this year brought down\u00a0the Singaporean telecommunications company's\u00a0stake through direct and indirect holdings from 29.8\u00a0percent to 29\u00a0percent,\u00a0currently worth an estimated S$33 billion.Singtel, which has been a strategic investor in Airtel since 2000, previously in 2022 sold a 3.3\u00a0percent direct stake in Airtel for Rs 12,895 crore to Bharti Telecom, Airtel\u2019s holding company.Queries sent to Airtel, Singtel and Morgan Stanley didn\u2019t elicit a response.On Singtel\u2019s divestment plan, Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal in February this year told Moneycontrol it was Singtel\u2019s requirement to equalise its stake with Bharti promoters.\u201cBharti Telecom is 40 percent. I would want that to be the only vehicle holding all the stake in Airtel between us and Singtel. Singtel has some stake outside. We have some stake outside\u2026The idea is to eventually bring it there or make some sales in the market so you do equalise. It\u2019s their need, not ours,\u201d he had said at that time.Bharti Telecom, which\u00a0held 39.37 percent in Bharti Airtel, as on March 31, 2024, is 50.56 percent owned by the Mittal family, while Singtel\u00a0has a 49.44 percent stake in the holding company.Singtel\u2019s direct holding in Bharti Airtel stands at 9.56 percent, while the Mittal family owns a 4.53 percent direct stake through an entity called Indian Continent Investment Ltd.For Singtel, the stake sales are part of a strategy started in 2021 to reduce debt and provide more value to shareholders through dividends besides funding the growth of its data centre and IT services.By the end of September 2023, this approach has enabled Singtel to cut its net debt by S$3.2 billion and distribute S$0.8 billion in special dividends to shareholders from capital recycling.\n       ",

    "Shares of Bharti Airtel hit an all-time high while Vodafone Idea and Indus Towers stocks scaled 52-week peaks in morning deals on June 28 as leading telecom firms in India have started increasing mobile plan tariffs. The stocks, however, gave up gains later in the day and were trading up to 3 percent lower.According to Morgan Stanley, the tariff hikes are in line with market expectations in terms of timing and magnitude.Reliance Jio revised tariffs on Thursday, followed by Bharti Airtel, which hiked rates by 10 percent to 21 percent. Bharti Hexacom's circle rates have also been hiked.According to Taher Badshah of Invesco Mutual Fund, the hikes were expected within the industry.In an interview with CNBC TV18, he noted a cautious approach towards spending on spectrum acquisition, suggesting companies that have effectively executed their strategies and delivered strong results have experienced a re-rating in their valuations.Follow our market blog to catch all the live actionAnalysts at Morgan Stanley estimate a significant increase of 16-18 percent in blended Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) for both Bharti Airtel and Reliance Jio.Following Jio's tariff adjustments, Bharti Airtel's stock is projected to establish a new price floor in the range of Rs 1,000-Rs 1,050. Looking ahead, the brokerage foresees a potential upside of 11-15 percent assuming current valuation multiples are sustained over the next year based on conservative projections.CLSA noted that Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea tariffs were at a 20-25 percent premium to Jio. Meanwhile, Bernstein feels Vodafone Idea is expected to grow by 20-25 percent. According to JP Morgan, Jio's tariff\u00a0revision has shifted focus from market share gains.Jefferies has maintained a Buy rating on Bharti Airtel with a target price of Rs 1,720 per share. The brokerage noted that Reliance Jio's tariff adjustment, excluding feature phone users, indicates a continued focus on expanding its subscriber base. Jio's new tariff plans underscores its heightened focus on monetization strategies.The international brokerage expects Reliance Jio to achieve 18 percent and 26 percent CAGRs in revenue and PAT respectively from FY24 to FY27.

    "India's second largest telecom operator Bharti Airtel has announced a hike in mobile tariffs by as much as 10-21 percent, following Reliance Jio. Sunil Bharti Mittal's telecom firm said it will revise mobile tariffs from 3 July 2024, with a 'very modest' price increase of less than 70 paise per day on entry-level plans.Bharti Airtel maintained that the mobile telecom service Average Revenue per User (ARPU) needs to rise above Rs 300 for the financial health of the telecom businesses in India.\"We believe that this level of ARPU will enable the substantial\u00a0investments required in network technology and spectrum and offer a modest return on capital,\" the telecom firm said in a statement.Further, Bharti Airtel said that the company welcomes\u00a0the industry announcement\u00a0to 'repair tariffs'.Earlier this week, Reliance Jio revised mobile tariffs, unveiling a\u00a0series of new unlimited plans with effect from 3 July 2024.\u00a0The new tariff plans range from Rs 189 for 2 GB per month to Rs 3,599 for 2.5 GB per day annual plan. These plans include unlimited 5G data for all plans with 2GB/day and above.Following this, a revision in mobile tariffs by Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Ideas were widely anticipated. Telecom firms in India\u00a0have long advocated tariff increases as essential for sustainable growth.Bharti Airtel and its Chairman Sunil Mittal\u00a0have repeatedly expressed the need to increase the current ARPU from about Rs 200 to Rs 300 or more. \"We need to be at the Rs 300 ARPU level. First pitstop was Rs 200. That\u2019s taken five to six years,\" said Mittal in an interview to Moneycontrol in February this year. Bharti Airtel's ARPU topped Rs 200 (at Rs 208) in Q3 FY24.The last industry-wide tariff hike of about 20% was in December 2021. Before that, telcos hiked tariffs in December 2019, the first one after Jio launched its service in 2016.The 2019 hike increased the tariff by 20-40%, while the 2021 hike saw an increase of 20%, providing an ARPU uplift of Rs 30 and 36 over four quarters to Airtel, respectively.The earlier two hikes of 14-30 percent pushed ARPU up by 10-16 percent for Bharti Airtel and Jio, implying an ARPU transmission rate of 50-70 percent.\"We assume a similar transmission rate this time around. The full effect of this tariff hike will be visible in the December quarter,\" Axis Capital said in a note seen by Moneycontrol.\"We believe the Airtel's tariff hike announcement could give an immediate boost to stock sentiment, as seen in 2019 and 2021. However, we believe this tariff hike won\u2019t necessarily lead to any material upgrade to our/ consensus EBITDA estimates,\"\u00a0Morgan Stanley said in a separate note.Analysts expect the industry growth rate to accelerate in coming quarters, led by tariff hikes.BNP Paribas expects the Indian telecom industry\u2019s revenue growth to remain in double digits over FY 24-26, led by tariff hikes and customers upgrading to bundled plans.\u00a0\n       ",

We believe tariff hikes of 15-20% are imminent post the conclusion of telecom spectrum auction with subsequent frequent tariff hikes going forward to aid the needed tariff repair. After an elevated capex in FY24, a decline in capex intensity in FY25 and possible tariff hikes is likely to aid a meaningful uptick in FCF generation.OutlookWe reiterate a Buy on Bharti Airtel with a revised PT of Rs. 1680 owing to its industry leading ARPU, incremental revenue market share gains and as it is well placed to be a key beneficiary of the expected tariff hikes over FY25-26E.For all recommendations report,\u00a0click hereDisclaimer:\u00a0The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

Scindia said: \"Spectrum auction 2024 was part of a continuous allocation process that is transparent, robust and progressive.

    "After monetising its stake in telecom tower company Indus Towers Ltd, Vodafone Group Plc is looking to invest as much as Rs 3,000 crore of equity in its Indian telecom joint venture Vodafone Idea Ltd, according to people aware of the development.On June 19, Vodafone Group announced that it had sold an 18\u00a0percent stake in Indus Towers for \u20ac1.7 billion (Rs 15,300 crore, approximately). Indus Towers shares were sold by Vodafone Plc in the price range of Rs 315.99 to Rs 325 per share.The company said that it will use the major portion of the proceeds to repay a large part of the \u00a0\u20ac1.8 billion in outstanding bank borrowings secured against Indus Towers shares. It has not specified how much it will repay.On Monday, CNBC TV18 reported that Bharti Airtel is in talks with Vodafone Plc to buy an additional 3 percent stake in Indus Towers. Airtel had picked up a one percent stake in Indus last week in a block deal.According to the people cited, while the funds raised through the block deal were largely meant for repayment of loans taken against Indus shares as collateral, with further monetisation of its Indus stake, by way of the possible stake sale to Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Plc is planning to plough back a significant amount of capital into Vodafone Idea. If a transaction with Bharti Airtel is executed at the same price range as the block deal, Vodafone\u00a0Group could garner a further Rs 2,500 crore.The persons cited added that Vodafone Group is looking to invest as much as Rs 3,000 crore in the telco, with a large part of it coming from the Indus stake. Further the telecom player may also raise some amount in the form of debt to fund the investment in Vodafone Idea.An email sent to Vodafone Group did not elicit a response till press time.Vodafone Group\u2019s plans to invest equity into Vodafone Idea come on the back of a successful Rs 18,000 crore follow-on public offering by the telco in April, which saw participation from investors such as GQG Partners, Fidelity, HDFC MF, and Motilal Oswal MF, among others.The April fundraise is expected to help Vodafone Idea to fund the setting up of its 5G network, while also strengthening its 4G network coverage across key geographies in India.Also Read:\u00a0How Vodafone Idea plans to spend its Rs 18,000 cr FPO proceedsLast week Moneycontrol reported that persistent pressure from lenders over an outstanding loan taken around five years ago were among the key reasons why the UK's Vodafone Group sold its stake in Indus Towers.Moneycontrol reported that matters came to a head after a group of foreign banks, led by BNP Paribas, HSBC and Bank of America among others, refused to extend the tenor of the loan and demanded full repayment. The loan had been raised against Vodafone Group\u2019s 21.05\u00a0percent stake in Indus Towers for it to participate in Vodafone Idea\u2019s rights issue in March 2019.Several domestic and foreign institutional investors, including Norges Bank, Jane Street, SBI Mutual Fund, and Millennium Funds, purchased shares of telecom towers operator Indus Towers from\u00a0 Vodafone Group, according to data from stock exchanges and sources who spoke to Moneycontrol.\n       ",
    "Bharti Airtel is talks with Vodafone Plc to buy 3 percent additional stake in telecom towers company Indus Towers, reported CNBC TV18, citing unidentified sources. Bharti Airtel stock was little changed\u00a0on June 24, trading at Rs 1,414.3 in the afternoon, marginally down from the previous close.Earlier, last week,\u00a0Vodafone group had sold an 18 percent equity stake in Indus Towers in block deals for about Rs 15,300 crore. With this, Vodafone group is now left with a 3.1 percent\u00a0shareholding in Indus Towers.Bharti Airtel had bought 1\u00a0percent additional stake in Indus Towers in the transaction, taking its holding in the towers company to\u00a0\u00a0nearly 49 percent. The proposed additional stake acquisition would make Bharti Airtel the majority stakeholder in Indus Towers\u00a0with a 52 percent shareholding.Airtel plans to\u00a0Indus Towers with its data centre business Nxtra, reported CNBC TV18. Further, Indus Towers cash would be used for Nxtra expansion, said the report. Airtel aims to make its telecom business asset light via Nextra and Indus Towers merger.The merger would unlock value, and would also give\u00a0exit to Carlyle from its investment. Private Equity major\u00a0Carlyle had bought a 24 percent stake in Nxtra in 2020.Consolidation of the majority shareholding in Indus Towers, and then merging it with the data centre business is apparently part of Bharti Airtel's mega plan to of two-pronged strategy to capitalise on Indus Towers.On the other hand, Vodafone is likely to use stake sale proceeds to pay dues to Indus Towers. A recent Reuters report had said that Vodafone Group was\u00a0looking to\u00a0sell\u00a0its entire $2.3 billion stake in Indus Towers as part of a strategic move to pare its hefty debt.The proceeds from this stake sale are earmarked for trimming down Vodafone's significant $42.17 billion net debt, the Reuters report added.\u00a0Back in 2022, Vodafone announced intentions to offload its then-28 percent stake in Indus Towers, but progress had been slow till last week.\n       ",
    "Bharti Airtel said on June 19 that it has acquired 1 percent additional equity stake in Indus Towers, shortly after it was reported that UK's Vodafone group has sold as much as 20 percent shareholding in the towers company.Bharti Airtel said it has bought 2.695 crore shares in Indus Towers 'on-market'. Sunil Mittal-led telecom company had got the directors' approval for acquisition of upto 2.7 crore shares. Before this, Bharti Airtel held 47.95 percent equity stake in Indus Towers.Earlier today, Vodafone group reportedly sold as many as 53.3 crore shares in Indus Towers for Rs 17,065 crore.\u00a0Private equity firms I Squared Capital and Stonepeak were also among the interested buyers for Vodafone's stake in Indus Towers.The sale is a move by Vodafone to streamline its financials.\u00a0Vodafone Group had earlier announced in 2022 its intention to sell its then 28% stake, aiming to reduce its hefty $42.17 billion net debt.\u00a0However, progress had been slow so far, with only a fraction of the stake sold.Analysts at JPMorgan have noted that the sale could generate a substantial cash influx, estimated at $2.3 billion. This would facilitate quicker debt repayments to vendors, including Indus Towers, and might even enable a special dividend for the shareholders of the Indian tower company.The block deal led to a 10\u00a0percent drop in Indus Towers' stock price to an intraday low of Rs 311.40 on the NSE, before paring losses and trading at Rs 331 in the afternoon.Bharti Airtel share price fell, and was trading down 1 percent at Rs 1,414 on June 19.\u00a0\n       ",

The company is well poised to benefit from sector tailwinds, including market share gains, improved ARPU driven by the premiumization of customers and tariff hikes as well as growth in non-wireless segments such as Home and Enterprise, the brokerage firm said.Reiterating its 'Neutral' rating on Vodafone Idea, Motilal Oswal pointed out a\u00a0reduction in AGR liability, restriction in subscriber churn rate, and potential tariff hikes as key catalysts for the stock.Disclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts on Moneycontrol.com are their own and not those of the website or its management.
