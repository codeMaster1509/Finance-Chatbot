The growth was partly aided by further progress in mega deal within Telecom, otherwise the growth was board-based (ex-Retail). The margin impact was meaningful, down 210bps QoQ (vs consensus of 130bps decline). The decline was led by normalizing high-margin P&P business coupled with compensation revision that was long due for the mid and senior-level leadership team. The deal TCV wins were healthy at USD2.3b (+10.4% YoY), which takes FY24 TCV to USD9.75b (BTB 1.0x).

    "Motilal Oswal's research report on HCL TechnologiesHCL Technologies (HCLT) reported weak 4QFY24 performance with 0.3% QoQ CC consolidated revenue growth, below our estimate of 0.9% QoQ CC.The weak performance was due to the seasonality in HCL Software (-18.5% QoQ CC) coupled with weakness in ERS (1.6% QoQ CC), while ITBS posted an impressive 4% QoQ growth in CC. Services grew 3.0% QoQ in CC, above our estimate of +2.7% QoQ. The new deal TCV was healthy at USD2.3b (+18.8% QoQ/10.4% YoY) in 4QFY23. HCLT announced disappointing revenue growth guidance of 3-5% CC for FY25, amid weak 1QFY25 expectations (-2% QoQ). The weak expectations are led by the offshoring of a large deal and the transfer of productivity benefits to clients. EBIT margin came in lower than expected at 17.6% (-220bp QoQ; missing our estimate of 18.5%) due to the HCL Software seasonality. Services margin contracted 70bp QoQ. Management retained its EBIT margin guidance band of 18-19% for FY25.Outlookwe expect HCLT to emerge stronger on the back of healthy demand for these services in the medium term. The stock is trading at ~20x FY26E EPS, which offers a margin of safety. Our TP of INR1,700 is based on 23x FY26E EPS. We reiterate our BUY rating on the stock.For all recommendations report, click hereDisclaimer: The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own, and not that of the website or its management.

    "Technically, the Nifty 50 is almost on the verge of an upward sloping long support trendline. Hence, the index may try to defend the trendline. In case the index breaks the same, then 21,500 is expected to be an immediate support, but on the higher side, if the index holds above the trendline, then 21,700-21,800 can be a resistance zone, experts said.On February 12, the Nifty 50 plummeted 167 points to 21,616 and formed long bearish candlestick pattern on the daily charts, while the BSE Sensex was down more than 500 points to 71,072. The broader markets hit hard as the Nifty Midcap 100 index tanked 2.5 percent and Smallcap 100 index plunged 4 percent.Stocks that bucked the trend included Zydus Lifesciences, HCL Technologies, and Apollo Hospitals Enterprises. Zydus Lifesciences rallied 6.4 percent to end at record closing high of Rs 857 and formed strong bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts, with robust volumes, while on the monthly basis, it has continued run up for fourth consecutive month.HCL Technologies, too, ended at new closing high of Rs 1,667, up 2.2 percent and formed bullish candlestick pattern on the daily timeframe with above average volumes.

Currently, the stock is trading at the life time high.On the daily chart, prices which were moving in an upward sloping channel has given a breakout of it, which is a positive sign.

So, as long as price holds above mentioned level, medium-term trend is likely to remain positive.In short, trend for Zydus Life remains positive. Since RSI (relative strength index) is in overbought territory, so buy on dips looks prudent strategy with the targets of Rs 875 as long as Rs 820 holds on the downside.Apollo Hospitals EnterprisesApollo Hospitals Enterprises has shown strong upside momentum since past few months.

    "After a firm opening, the Nifty gave up the early morning gains and remained under pressure throughout the session on February 12. The Nifty 50 lost 166 points to close at 21,616. Declining shares outnumbered the advancing shares as the advance-decline ratio stood at 0.33 on the BSE, lowest since January 23.The Nifty closed on a weak note below its 11 and 20 DMA (day moving average). In the derivatives, we have seen aggressive Call writing at 21,800-22,000 strikes. Moreover, we have seen the index forming multiple tops around 22,000 mark during the last few days, suggesting that on the upside, the 21,800-22,000 levels would act as a strong resistance. Therefore, traders are advised to remain cautious till the benchmark closes above 22,000.Immediate support for the Nifty is seen at 21,448 and 21,137, derived from the previous swing lows.The broader market indices like Midcap and Smallcap have started underperforming, compared to the Nifty, having lost 4.2 percent and 6.5 percent from their recent tops as against a 2.3 percent fall in the Nifty.Short-term trend of the Midcap/Smallcap Indices turned bearish after many weeks as they closed below its important moving averages.

    "The market is expected to lack a direction in trading this week as well, unless the Nifty 50 gives a strong closing above 22,000 or sinks below 21,500, where the sacrosanct support is seen. This is likely to be a range for the index, experts said.The Nifty 50 shed a third of a percent amid volatility and closed at 21,783. The index has formed a bearish candlestick pattern with higher and lower shadows on the weekly scale.\"The time-wise correction phase continued with intermediate support at 21,680 (20 DEMA - day exponential moving average), followed by the sacrosanct support of 21,500 for the current week. On the flip side, the 21,900-22,000 zone remains a daunting task for the bulls, followed by the sturdy hurdle of 22,100,\" Sameet Chavan, research head for technical and derivatives at Angel One, said.A decisive breakthrough beyond the mentioned support or resistance zone could only trigger the next leg of the rally in the market, he feels. Chavan advises to have a pragmatic approach while keeping the zone in mind.Looking ahead to the next week, Jigar S Patel, senior manager of equity research at Anand Rathi, also feels that it's crucial for traders to closely monitor the 21,500 level, which is identified as a significant support level. A breach of this level could potentially trigger panic in the market, he said.Traders should keep a close eye on key support and resistance levels (22,000\u201322,100) and remain flexible in their trading strategies, he advised.It appears that the past week was indeed characterised by significant volatility, with the India VIX surpassing 15 level again and closing at 15.45 level on a weekly scale. This suggests that market participants should brace themselves for potentially heightened volatility in the coming week, Jigar said.Moneycontrol collated a list of top 10 stock\u00a0ideas from experts with 3-4 weeks perspective.

The phase of consolidation may last as long as the index trades below the 21,000 mark, with immediate support at 20,850 and crucial support at the 20,500-20,300 levels, but if the index decisively closes above 21,000, then 21,500 could be the possibility, experts said.The Nifty50 has seen a strong gap-up opening in the week ended December 8, and jumped 3.46 percent to end at a record closing high of 20,969, forming a healthy bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts with higher-high-higher-low formation for yet another week.\"In the upcoming week, 20,850 is viewed as an immediate support, and sustained trading below this level could trigger a price correction, potentially bringing prices towards the next support at 20,700,\" Sameet Chavan, research head for technical and derivatives at Angel One, said.He further said the primary support zone remained the bullish gap created last week, ranging from 20,500 to 20,300, and as long as it holds, the secular bull run is expected to persist and any type of correction would be considered healthy for primary uptrend.On the other hand, identifying key resistance is challenging in uncharted territory, but the 21,100 levels, representing a reciprocal golden (161.8 percent) retracement of the recent fall, holds technical significance, he added.Ajit Mishra, SVP of\u00a0technical research at Religare Broking, also said the Nifty has the potential to test the 21,200-21,500 zone and expects the index to hold the 20,300-20,550 zone in case investors decide to take some money off table.He maintains a positive view on the market, despite the overbought conditions and suggests participants to look for buying opportunities on dips, while Sameet advised traders to focus on thematic movements for potentially outperforming trades while remaining vigilant in the dynamic market environment.Moneycontrol collated the list of 10 stock picks from experts, which can generate healthy returns in the coming 3-4 weeks, from the closing price December 8:Subash Gangadharan, senior technical and derivative analyst at HDFC SecuritiesKotak Mahindra Bank: Buy | LTP: Rs 1,838 | Stop-Loss: Rs 1,750 | Target: Rs 2,000 | Return: 9 percentKotak Bank has shown relative strength last week.
