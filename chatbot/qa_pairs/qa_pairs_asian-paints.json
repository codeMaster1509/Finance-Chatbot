This subdued growth is attributed to a slowdown in overall consumption and increased competitive intensity, which impacted volume growth despite price cuts implemented by the company.\",\n        \"context\": \"According to a poll of seven brokerages, Asian Paints' topline is projected to reach Rs 9017 crore for the March quarter, marking a marginal 2.6 percent increase compared to Rs 8787 crore in the same period last year. This muted growth can be attributed to several factors. Primarily, there's an ongoing slowdown in overall consumption, affecting demand across various sectors, including paints. Additionally, the paint industry is experiencing heightened competitive intensity, putting pressure on volume growth. Asian Paints' efforts to stimulate demand through price cuts of around 3 percent have not yielded significant results, further contributing to the anticipated muted revenue growth.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"question\": \"How did Asian Paints' price cuts impact their sales during the March quarter?\",\n        \"answer\": \"Despite implementing price cuts of around 3%, Asian Paints did not experience a significant increase in sales.

However, this strategic move did not translate into a substantial increase in sales.
