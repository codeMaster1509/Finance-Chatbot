This impact is primarily attributed to the transition to the new tax regime, which has eliminated many deductions that previously incentivized customers to purchase life insurance. Policies with a ticket size of less than Rs 1 lakh are particularly sensitive to these changes, as they are impacted by the deductions under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act.\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"question\": \"What challenges do analysts foresee for life insurers like ICICI Prudential in the near term?\",\n        \"answer\": \"Analysts foresee challenges such as margin pressures and increased competition for ICICI Prudential due to revised EoM guidelines and the shift towards lower ticket-sized policies.\",\n        \"context\": \"Despite the anticipated growth in the life insurance sector, analysts express concerns regarding the near to medium-term challenges faced by companies like ICICI Prudential.

Furthermore, as the market adapts to the new tax regime, there is a noted shift in consumer behavior towards lower ticket-sized policies, which may further complicate the competitive landscape.
