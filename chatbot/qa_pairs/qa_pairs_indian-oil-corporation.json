Their costs remained higher than expected compared to the benchmark Dubai crude oil, indicating they couldn\\'t fully monetize the discounted Russian oil.', 'context': \"The passage highlights how despite India reducing its crude oil import costs by utilizing discounted Russian oil, Indian OMCs haven't maximized this benefit.

This contrasts with companies like Nayara Energy (owned by Russia's Rosneft), which directly benefits from the discounted Russian crude due to its ownership structure. The report further explains that Indian OMCs face higher transportation and insurance costs compared to Nayara Energy, hindering their ability to fully capitalize on the cheaper oil.
