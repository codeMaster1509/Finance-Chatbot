Despite a slew of new launches and affordable variants introduced by top manufacturers, sales only reached 222,127 units, a marginal 1.62% increase from the 218,574 units sold in the same period last year.

        "answer": "Rohan Kanwar Gupta, Vice President & Sector Head - Corporate Ratings at ICRA, attributes the moderation in E2W sales to two primary factors: the reduction in government subsidies under the EMPS 2024 and the impact of pre-buying that occurred in March 2024 ahead of the subsidy reduction.",
        "context": "Rohan Kanwar Gupta, Vice President & Sector Head - Corporate Ratings at ICRA, highlights two key reasons for the subdued E2W sales in Q1 FY25. Firstly, the reduction in subsidy benefits under the newly implemented Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme (EMPS) 2024 played a role. Secondly, the market experienced a surge in pre-buying during March 2024 as customers rushed to capitalize on the existing FAME2 Policy benefits before they were phased out. This pre-buying spree created an artificial inflation in sales figures in the preceding months, leading to a subsequent moderation in Q1 FY25."
