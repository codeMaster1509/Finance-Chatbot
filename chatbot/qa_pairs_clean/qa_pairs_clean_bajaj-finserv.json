        "question": "What investment strategy did Govind Parikh adopt after the 2008 market crash?",
        "answer": "After the 2008 market crash, Govind Parikh adopted a strategy of maintaining cash reserves and not waiting for stock prices to fall significantly before selling.",
        "context": "The market crash of 2008 was a significant learning experience for Govind Parikh, prompting him to reevaluate his investment strategy. He implemented two key changes: first, he began keeping a portion of his portfolio in cash to ensure liquidity during market downturns. Second, he decided not to wait for stock prices to fall all the way before selling. Instead, he established a threshold, allowing for a decline of up to 20% before taking action. This strategy emphasizes capital protection and allows for more agile responses to market conditions. For instance, during the COVID-19 market meltdown in March 2020, he seized the opportunity to invest in Tata Motors at a low price"
