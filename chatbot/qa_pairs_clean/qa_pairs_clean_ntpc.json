The central bank had placed APSEZ on its watch list for possible exclusion since March 2022 due to its business activities in Myanmar, which raised alarms regarding the violation of individual rights in conflict situations. Although APSEZ sold its Myanmar asset entirely in May of the previous year, the lack of transparency surrounding the sale and the buyer prevented the Norwegian Fund's Council of Ethics from confirming whether APSEZ had severed all ties with the enterprise involved.
